Depois do achado, escavações apontaram mais 30 fósseis no local. Descoberta de fóssil que deu origem a Museu de Monte Alto completa 40 anos
Em uma manhã de abril de 1985, Elvira Aparecida Franciosi, então estudante de História e Geografia, descobriria algo que colocaria Monte Alto (SP) no mapa do mundo da paleontologia. 
Siga o canal g1 Ribeirão e Franca no WhatsApp 
Ela pastorava o gado em uma área próxima ao sítio da família, quando algo entre as rochas chamou a atenção. 
Elvira ainda não sabia, mas estava diante de um fóssil de dinossauro, o primeiro encontrado na região e que, posteriormente, daria início ao Museu de Paleontologia de Monte Alto, um dos mais importantes da América Latina. 
""Eu tinha muita vaca de leite, então, tirava o leite e levava o gado pastorear naquele [campo] aberto lá, onde não tinha uma casa. Pastorava o gado lá. Eu estava a cavalo e descia do cavalo para ficar olhando. Então, eu encontrei o fóssil"". 
Primeiro fóssil de Titanossauro encontrado em Monte Alto (SP) completa 40 anos em abril

A rocha onde o fóssil estava, ficava em uma valeta que se formou por conta da erosão do solo. 
O ponto exato foi coberto pelo asfalto ao longo dos anos, mas Elvira sabe bem como identificar: é uma mancha bem ao lado da sinalização de solo 'Pare'. (veja imagem abaixo)
A área, antes tomada pela terra, virou o bairro residencial Jardim Paulista, e ficou conhecida como Estrada do Campestre, porque é caminho para o clube de lazer de Monte Alto.

Depois do primeiro fóssil encontrado por Elvira, equipes de escavações descobriram outros 30 no mesmo local. 
Anos mais tarde, pesquisadores identificaram que todos eles se tratavam de fósseis do Titanossauro do Campestre, uma espécie de dinossauro herbívoro que viveu na região de Monte Alto entre 70 e 83 milhões de anos.
Escavações encontraram mais 30 fósseis no mesmo lugar onde primeiro fóssil de Monte Alto (SP) foi achado

'Sabia que não era osso de boi'
Elvira tinha 20 anos na época que encontrou o primeiro fóssil. Hoje, aos 62, ela lembra do dia em que tudo aconteceu e diz que a única certeza que tinha era de que não se tratava de um osso comum.
""Eu sempre trabalhei no matadouro, eu sempre matei muito gado, então conheço a ossada toda de um boi. Eu vi que não era de um boi, mas achei que era a paleta de um bicho"".

Tiago Aureliano/EPTV
Ao g1, ela contou que chegou a falar do assunto para o professor da faculdade, mas ele não deu tanta importância à descoberta. 
Foi então que o pai de Elvira avisou o professor Antônio Celso de Arruda Campos, paleontólogo autodidata e o principal responsável pela escavação para a retirada do primeiro fóssil de Monte Alto, há 40 anos.
""Meu pai, um dia conversando com o professor Antônio Celso no posto de gasolina, falou 'a Lila encontrou um negócio esquisito'. Aí o Celso foi lá e viu com o farolete, à noite mesmo. Clareou lá e viu que era um fóssil. Aí começou toda a história do osso do dinossauro"". 
As escavações no local duraram quase cinco anos. Como Monte Alto ainda não tinha um museu, cada fóssil encontrado era armazenado nas casas de Antônio Celso e Cledinei Aparecido Francisco, que tinha 16 anos à época e fazia parte da equipe.
""A gente se reunia para caçar dinossauros, ficava sábado e domingo. Ficamos meses para retirar. Foram várias etapas, pelo menos quatro ou cinco etapas de grandes escavações. Até que, então, finalzinho de 1990 a gente vai acabar com todo o cenário das escavações"", diz Cledinei.

Pedido especial ao prefeito
Coordenadora do Museu de Paleontologia de Monte Alto, Sandra Tavares conta que a criação do museu só foi possível por conta do esforço político de Antônio Celso.
Depois de muitos fósseis armazenados na própria casa, a mulher do professor começou a pedir que eles fossem retirados do local. Antônio Celso, então, passou a insistir por um espaço diretamente com o prefeito da época, Elias Bahdur. 
""Eles colocaram [os fósseis] em uma salinha que já existia e ele pedindo 'preciso de um espaço maior, preciso de um espaço maior'. Aí o doutor Elias, que na época era o prefeito, falou 'vou te fazer um museu'. E fez. E construiu o museu. Foi por esforço político do professor Antônio Celso que ele conseguiu o museu"", diz Sandra.
O Museu de Paleontologia fica no Centro Cívico e Cultural Doutor Elias Bahdur, na Praça do Centenário, no Centro da cidade. O espaço abriga também o Museu Histórico e o Museu de Arqueologia.
O complexo virou referência nacional e internacional por conta do acervo inédito de espécies de diferentes animais pré-históricos.
""Tornou-se uma referência muito grande, porque nossa coleção é bem significante e que atrai pesquisadores e o público em geral. Se eu tenho um fóssil inédito na mão, da mesma forma que eu tenho de comparar com os fósseis já descritos em outros países, os pesquisadores de outros países também tem de comparar o trabalho deles com o nosso"".
Para Sandra, o museu tem grande importância não só para a pesquisa, mas também para a popularização da ciência e da paleontologia. 
Os primeiros fósseis do museu
Os primeiros fósseis do museu foram justamente aqueles encontrados na Estrada do Campestre. Após as escavações, eles ainda foram objeto de estudos nos anos seguintes, já com um espaço específico para isso. 
Mas o trabalho de identificação é extremamente longo e só em 2000 pesquisadores descobriram que aquele encontrado por Elvira se tratava do fêmur de um Titanossauro.

Tiago Aureliano/EPTV
Por ter sido encontrada na Estrada do Campestre, a espécie recebeu o nome de Titanossauro do Campestre. 
Mas os estudos com os fósseis descoberto naquela região ainda não terminaram. Segundo Sandra, a ideia, agora, é produzir um artigo científico.
""Estamos trabalhando na descrição dos fósseis encontrados em 1985 no Campestre e que deram origem a criação do museu. O estudo acontece em parceria com pesquisadores da USP, Unicamp e UFRJ. Em 2017, alguns destes pesquisadores envolvidos neste estudo estiveram no museu e me pediram para olhar esses fósseis e, de lá pra cá, o artigo está sendo produzido"". 
Ainda segundo a paleontóloga, há  indícios de que os fósseis pertençam a, pelo menos, três indivíduos: um adulto e, talvez, dois jovens. 
A proposta do artigo, diz Sandra, é afirmar uma nova espécie. Se isto acontecer, os pesquisadores vão decidir o nome científico que será dado ao Titanossauro do Campestre.

Mudou radicalmente seu estilo de vida e, aos 80, irá da Califórnia à Flórida para oferecer uma mensagem de esperança. No dia 5 de abril, Judy Benjamin iniciou sua caminhada de 3 mil milhas (cerca de 4.8 mil quilômetros). Aos 80 anos, partiu de San Diego, na Califórnia, e pretende chegar a Saint Augustine, na Flórida, em seis meses. Por trás dessa empreitada, que seria árdua em qualquer idade, uma causa que a mobiliza: aumentar a conscientização sobre a Doença de Alzheimer. 
Judy Benjamin: caminhada de quase 5 mil quilômetros para aumentar a conscientização sobre o Alzheimer
Divulgação
Sua mãe lutou contra a enfermidade durante duas décadas e a própria Judy foi diagnosticada há 13 anos. Desde então, mudou radicalmente seu estilo de vida para retardar ao máximo a progressão da doença, e procura oferecer uma mensagem de esperança: a de que é possível combater os sintomas do Alzheimer. Sua jornada não será solitária. Ela terá uma equipe de suporte e outra de filmagem, para a produção de um documentário. O objetivo é percorrer 20 milhas (32 quilômetros) diariamente, com um dia descanso por semana.
Judy segue um rigoroso protocolo voltado para prevenir o declínio mental, criado pelo médico Dale Bredesen, que a considera seu “paciente zero”. O sucesso do tratamento a transformou em coach de bem-estar. “Quero compartilhar com as pessoas que é possível conviver com o Alzheimer e ser saudável, espero que se sintam encorajadas”, diz. 
O diagnóstico, aos 67 anos, não a surpreendeu. Os sintomas começaram pouco depois da morte da mãe, que havia sido diagnosticada aos 63 anos – nove tios tinham o mesmo problema. “Eu não me lembrava dos nomes dos netos, tinha dificuldade de ler o jornal e esquecia até o número do meu celular”, conta.
Foi quando descobriu o doutor Bredesen e adotou seu programa, que incluía melhorar a qualidade do sono, fazer meditação e uma rotina vigorosa de exercícios, além de uma dieta saudável, com alimentos integrais e sem açúcar. “Ele me explicou que o Alzheimer não é causado por uma única coisa, e sim por uma série de agressões ao cérebro”, afirmou.",https://g1.globo.com/bemestar/blog/longevidade-modo-de-usar/post/2025/04/22/paciente-com-alzheimer-inicia-caminhada-de-quase-5-mil-quilometros-em-campanha-de-conscientizacao-sobre-a-doenca.ghtml,pt
'Conclave': o que é real e o que é invenção no filme ganhador de Oscar?,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 07:01:08 -0000",Globo (Brazil),Brazil,"Obra ganhou como melhor roteiro adaptado no Oscar 2025. Assista ao trailer do filme ""Conclave""
O filme ""Conclave""(2024) gerou o interesse de pessoas ao redor do mundo no processo de seleção de um novo papa. 
Ganhadora de um Oscar de melhor roteiro adaptado e inspirada no livro de mesmo nome de Robert Harris, a obra de ficção mistura com habilidade fatos reais e licenças criativas sobre a eleição papal.
Mas, afinal o que é real e o que é completa invenção no filme?
O que é real
✅Procedimento do conclave: Os cardeais realmente se reúnem na Capela Sistina, entregam seus votos em cédulas, e a fumaça (preta ou branca) indica o resultado. O isolamento dos cardeais também é real. O professor de história da Universidade de Maryland, Piotr H. Kosicki, ressaltou apenas ""New York Times"" que todos os rituais no Vaticano são praticados ""em italiano ou latim. Ponto"";
✅Tensões políticas na Igreja: O filme acerta ao mostrar divisões ideológicas entre cardeais, algo comum nas eleições papais, com disputas entre alas conservadoras e progressistas. ""Mesmo com pessoas que têm boa vontade e que estão trabalhando pelo melhor da Igreja, pelo bem da Igreja, há desentendimentos. Isso é humano e é normal"", disse o reverendo Thomas Reese à rádio americana NPR;
✅Clima de segredo e introspecção: A atmosfera de tensão, silêncio e ritualismo condiz com o ambiente real do conclave.
O que é invenção
❌Participação de um cardeal “in pectore”: No filme, um cardeal secreto aparece no conclave. Na vida real, isso só seria possível se o papa revelasse seu nome antes de morrer — o que não ocorre na trama.
❌Reviravoltas dramáticas e revelações pessoais: O enredo inclui segredos explosivos, tensões quase cinematográficas entre cardeais e até ameaças físicas — esses elementos são invenções para fins dramáticos.",https://g1.globo.com/pop-arte/cinema/noticia/2025/04/22/conclave-o-que-e-real-e-o-que-e-invencao-no-filme-ganhador-de-oscar.ghtml,pt

O acidente aconteceu no sábado (19) e envolveu dois veículos, uma caminhonete Ford Ranger branca e um carro Hyundai HB20 prata. Como o nome do motorista não foi divulgado, o g1 não conseguiu contato com a defesa dele até a última atualização desta reportagem. 
Segundo a PRF, os dois motoristas foram submetidos ao teste do bafômetro. A condutora do HB20 não apresentou ingestão de álcool. Já o motorista da Ranger testou positivo, com 0,52 mg/L de álcool no sangue, teor considerado crime pela legislação, informou a polícia.
O HB20 trafegava no sentido Anápolis–Corumbá de Goiás quando, por motivos ainda desconhecidos, invadiu a pista contrária e colidiu frontalmente com a Ranger que seguia no sentido oposto, informou a PRF.
Segundo a Polícia Técnica Científica, Daniel Junio da Silva Barbosa, de 13 anos, morreu no local, o irmão de 6 anos, Samuel da Silva Barbosa, foi encaminhado ao Hospital Estadual de Anápolis Dr Henrique Santilho e teve o óbito confirmado no hospital.

A advogada Raquel Maria Pedro Saad e o marido Pérsio Antunes, que são de Anápolis, na região central de Goiás, receberam conselhos diretamente do papa Francisco. O momento da conversa ficou registrado e ela descreve o encontro como inesquecível.
""Foi um dia inesquecível na minha vida, que eu vou levar para a história do meu casamento, para os meus filhos e nunca vou esquecer os dois conselhos que ele nos deu: Que nós nunca terminássemos o dia brigados, e que um fosse sempre muito companheiro do outro"", contou Raquel.

A advogada conversou com o g1, e contou que o encontro do casal com o sumo pontífice foi em 13 de novembro de 2024, quando eles estiveram em Roma.  
""Nós nos casamos 22 de junho de 2024. E colocamos a ida para Roma na quarta-feira, que é o dia de audiência do Papa"", contou.
Raquel disse ainda que vai levar os conselhos do papa para o resto vida e que eles vão ser as diretrizes do seu matrimônio. Segundo ela, o encontro vai render ainda muita história para contar para os futuros filhos.

""Eu nunca vou esquecer, foi o dia que mais marcou a minha lua de mel, e um dos dias que mais marcaram a minha vida inteira. E para nós, como católicos, praticantes, foi algo inesquecível"", disse emocionada. 
A goiana descreveu o papa como uma pessoa que conseguia fazer qualquer um se sentir bem em sua presença. Segundo ela, era como se ela e o esposo fossem amigos do sumo pontífice.
""Ele segurando a nossa mão, fazendo piadinha no final, nos recebendo muito bem ali... Ele fazia com que qualquer um se sentisse bem na presença dele, cristão, não cristão, ele tinha esse poder de fazer com que as pessoas se sentissem assim"", disse.

O final desse encontro foi marcado por uma das principais características de Francisco: o bom humor. Raquel contou que o papa tinha perguntado de onde ela e o marido eram, e quando eles revelaram ser brasileiros o pontífice brincou. 
""Ele terminou falando que cachaça é bom, por isso que no final do vídeo todo mundo começa a dar gargalhada"", contou Raquel. 
Legado 
Os 12 anos em que Francisco ficou à frente da Igreja Católica foram marcados pela visão humilde e misericordiosa em defesa dos pobres, e pelas mensagens de acolhimento e amor.  
Raquel lembra um dos livros escritos pelo papa Francisco, que se chama 'O Nome de Deus é Misericórdia', como uma marca que o papa deixa. 
""Eu acho que o legado dele é esse, que a gente sempre tente olhar com amor quem está por perto, porque esse olhar misericordioso e amoroso, ele muda as coisas, muda as pessoas"", finalizou.

Última aparição
A última aparição pública do papa Francisco coincidiu com a festa da Páscoa, principal data do calendário católico, em que os cristãos comemoram a ressurreição de Jesus Cristo. No domingo de Páscoa (20), o pontífice fez questão de dar a benção para os fiéis que lotaram a praça São Pedro, no Vaticano.
A voz do santo padre estava fraca por causa dos problemas de saúde, e mesmo com as recomendações médicas ele fez questão de passar com o papamóvel próximo da multidão de fiéis e cumprimentou as crianças que estavam presentes.
Morte do papa
Jorge Mario Bergoglio, o papa Francisco, morreu aos 88 anos dentro de seu apartamento, a residência de Santa Marta. O imóvel fica na Cidade do Vaticano e era onde o pontífice vivia desde 2013, quando foi eleito.
""O Bispo de Roma, Francisco, retornou à casa do Pai. Toda a sua vida foi dedicada ao serviço do Senhor e de Sua Igreja. Ele nos ensinou a viver os valores do Evangelho com fidelidade, coragem e amor universal, especialmente em favor dos mais pobres e marginalizados"", disse o Vaticano em comunicado.
Segundo a certidão médica que atestou a morte, o papa sofreu um AVC cerebral, entrou em coma e teve um colapso cardiocirculatório irreversível às 7h35, no horário de Roma (2h35 em Brasília).
O boletim médico informa que o quadro foi agravado por pneumonia bilateral, bronquiectasias múltiplas, hipertensão e diabetes tipo 2. A morte foi confirmada por um exame de eletrocardiograma.
As cerimônias fúnebres de Francisco seguirão uma série de ritos e começaram já nesta segunda-feira, segundo o Vaticano. Os horários a seguir estão no horário de Brasília:
14h: missa de sufrágio pelo papa Francisco. Cerimônia ocorreu na Basílica de São João de Latrão, em Roma, e foi realizada pelo cardeal Baldo Reina. 
15h: ritos de constatação da morte e deposição do corpo de Francisco no caixão. A cerimônia ocorreu na capela privada do papa e foi presidida pelo camerlengo Farrell. 
Na manhã de quarta-feira (23), o corpo do papa será levado para a Basílica de São Pedro, em Roma, para que fiéis possam prestar a última homenagem ao papa. 
Francisco será enterrado na Basílica de Santa Maria Maggiore, em Roma, e não na Basílica de São Pedro, no Vaticano. A última vez que isso aconteceu foi em 1903, com o enterro do papa Leão XIII.

Após a visita ao Santuário Nacional, o papa Francisco foi levado de papamóvel ao Seminário Bom Jesus - local de formação de sacerdotes da Arquidiocese de Aparecida -, onde almoçou e permaneceu por cerca de três horas. O seminário fica a dois quilômetros do santuário.
De acordo com a Arquidiocese de Aparecida, ao chegar ao seminário, o pontífice recebeu flores e cumprimentou seminaristas e padres formadores. Em seguida, abençoou uma imagem de Santo Antônio de Sant'Ana Galvão e jogou terra em uma muda de pau-brasil, que foi plantada perto da imagem.
Visitas a Aparecida
Devoto da Padroeira do Brasil, o papa Francisco visitou duas vezes o Santuário Nacional de Nossa Senhora Aparecida, no interior de São Paulo. Clique aqui e relembre como foi.
A primeira das passagens foi discreta, em 2007, quando Jorge Mario Bergoglio ainda era cardeal e arcebispo de Buenos Aires. Na ocasião, ele participou de um evento que reuniu cardeais no templo católico.

Em março de 2023, imagens falsas do papa Francisco usando um casaco branco longo estilo 'puffer' viralizaram nas redes sociais. As fotografias foram criadas através do Midjourney, uma inteligência artificial que gera artes a partir de uma descrição textual.
Jorge Mario Bergoglio, o papa Francisco, morreu aos 88 nesta segunda-feira (21).  Segundo o Vaticano, a morte foi causada por um acidente vascular cerebral (AVC) e insuficiência cardíaca.

De tão realistas, as imagens chegaram a enganar alguns usuários nas redes sociais na época. ""O Papa é pop e estiloso!"", tuitou um perfil. A montagem que mais repercutiu, foi um ""clique"" do pontífice com o casaco e um crucifixo por cima (veja acima).
Em março de 2025, outra imagem que mostrava o papa internado usando máscara de oxigênio e batina viralizou e foi desmentida pelo Vaticano.
Em junho de 2024, o Papa Francisco se tornou o primeiro pontífice a se dirigir a uma cúpula do G7.  Durante o encontro, ele ressaltou a importância da inteligência artificial e de ferramentas que ajudem o ser humano a aumentar a sua sabedoria, mas enfatizou a importância do comportamento ético para limitar os danos que a IA pode causar (relembre abaixo).
Papa Francisco fala de inteligência artificial ao participar, pela primeira vez, da reunião do G7
“Nenhuma máquina deveria escolher tirar a vida de um ser humano”, disse ele, em referência ao uso de algoritmos na internet.
No início deste ano, o Vaticano voltou a se pronunciar sobre a tecnologia e reiterou o apelo para que os governos acompanhem de perto o avanço da inteligência artificial (IA). Segundo a Igreja, a IA carrega “a sombra do mal”, especialmente por seu potencial de disseminar desinformação.
""A mídia falsa gerada pela IA pode gradualmente minar as bases da sociedade"", disse o novo texto sobre ética da IA, escrito por dois departamentos do Vaticano e aprovado pelo Papa Francisco.
""Essa questão exige regulamentação cuidadosa, pois a desinformação — especialmente por meio de mídias controladas ou influenciadas pela IA — pode se espalhar de forma não intencional, alimentando a polarização política e o descontentamento social"", afirmou o documento.

Parte da história do Condomínio Aeronáutico Costa Esmeralda, em Porto Belo, no Litoral Norte de Santa Catarina, o piloto Flavius Neves morreu em um acidente com um girocóptero no Rio Grande do Norte na segunda-feira (21). Ele nasceu em Balneário Camboriú, também no Litoral Norte catarinense, e tinha 66 anos.
O girocóptero caiu na tarde de- segunda na praia de Areias Alvas, entre os municípios de Grossos e Tibau, na Costa Branca do Rio Grande do Norte. Além de Flavius, que era o piloto da aeronave, o passageiro Geraldo Francisco da Silva, de 42 anos, também morreu no acidente.

Flavius era o dono do girocóptero. Em uma rede social, ele postou vídeos na aeronave e filmou paisagens da divisa do Ceará com o Rio Grande do Norte (assista acima).
Nas redes sociais, ele brincava se definindo como ""nômade viajante mostrando a beleza do nosso país, voando de girocóptero, motoplanador, helicóptero, vassoura, etc"".
Ele era também sócio-diretor do Condomínio Aeronáutico Costa Esmeralda em Porto Belo, um local onde os moradores também têm um hangar para deixar a própria aeronave. A prefeitura lamentou a morte de Flavius e declarou que se trata de ""uma grande perda para a avião em Santa Catarina"".
No ano passado, o piloto perdeu um amigo, o empresário Mikael Minatti, que caiu de ultraleve em Itapema, no Litoral Norte de Santa Catarina. Flavius havia sido instrutor de voo dele.

Não é fácil fazer o que muitos críticos – e parte considerável do público – considera como ""a melhor coisa (série ou filme, tanto faz) de 'Star Wars' desde a primeira trilogia"". Por isso que ""Andor"" estreia sua segunda e última temporada nesta terça-feira (22) com uma mudança considerável de percurso.
Ainda antes de seu lançamento, em 2022, o plano era que cada temporada retratasse um ano da vida de seu protagonista até sua conclusão – mostrada no filme ""Rogue One: Uma história Star Wars"" (2016). É o que aconteceu na primeira e elogiada temporada. 
Na segunda, a equipe liderada pelo criador e roteirista Tony Gilroy e o astro e produtor-executivo Diego Luna liga o hiperpropulsor para chegar a seu destino em 12 parsecs ou menos.
""Não havia outra maneira de fazer. Nos sentamos na metade da primeira temporada. Estávamos filmando na Escócia. Tony veio e sentamos e falamos sobre como era impossível fazer cinco temporadas disso"", diz o ator mexicano em entrevista ao g1.
""Era a única forma de terminar.""

Quando Luna estrelou o filme, tinha cerca de 37 anos. Com os dois anos e meio necessários para fazer uma única temporada, chegaria ao final da série – e começo da história de ""Rogue One"" – com o rostinho de 53. Difícil explicar tamanha diferença.
Por isso, os novos 12 episódios são agrupados em grupos de três, com cada trio focado em um ano da vida do herói disponível semanalmente na plataforma de vídeos Disney+.
""Acho que é uma ótima ideia, porque pensamos em filmes. Esses são quatro filmes, basicamente. Fizemos quatro filmes e cada um deles cobre o que uma temporada ia cobrir. Achei que foi genial"", afirma o ator.
""Desde que eu comecei 'Rogue One' já são dez anos da minha vida, cara. E eu estou feliz que tivemos essa ideia, e feliz que terminamos no auge, quando ainda amamos o que fazemos, apaixonados, animados por fazê-lo."" 
""É assim que se termina. É isso o que esse personagem e essa história merecem.""

O lado mais sombrio
""Andor"" continua a história da formação do futuro herói da Aliança Rebelde, que no filme é um dos responsáveis pelo roubo dos projetos da Estrela da Morte – um ponto crucial para a derrota do maligno Império Galáctico.
Os episódios recebem novidades nem tão novas assim, como a já anunciada adesão de Ben Mendelsohn e seu odioso diretor Krennic, e o retorno de veteranos da série, como Kyle Soller, Stellan Skarsgard, Genevieve O'Reilly e Denise Gough.
A temporada também ajuda a aprofundar o relacionamento de Andor com a mecânica Bix (Adria Arjona) e as discussões sobre o lado mais sombrio de uma luta rebelde – temas mais maduros dentro do universo ""Star Wars"".
""É incrivelmente animador meio que ser esse reflexo de espelho da nossa história, e não necessariamente da nossa história de agora, desse momento, mas há muitas coisas que vemos nessa temporada, e algumas em que eu estou, que são reflexo do que acontece no nosso mundo"", diz Arjona.
""A experiência de ser uma mulher neste mundo. O uso errado do poder. Ou todos esses temas. E é incrível atuar isso e é incrível trazer esse realismo a 'Star Wars'.""

O papa Francisco recebeu e se reuniu com diversas autoridades brasileiras ao longo de seu pontificado. Se encontrou com os presidentes Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT), Dilma Rousseff (PT) e Michel Temer (MDB). 
O ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro (PL) não encontrou pontífice e criticou um texto postado pelo papa em uma rede social sobre a Amazônia.
Jorge Mario Bergoglio morreu aos 88 anos às 7h35 desta segunda no horário do Vaticano (2h35, no horário de Brasília). O pontífice ocupou o cargo máximo da Igreja Católica por 12 anos.
AVC causou a morte do papa Francisco
À frente da Igreja Católica por quase 12 anos, Francisco foi o papa número 266. Em 13 de março de 2013, durante o segundo dia do conclave para eleger o substituto de Bento XVI, Bergoglio foi escolhido como o novo líder – inclusive contra a sua própria vontade, segundo ele mesmo admitiu.
Lula decretou luto oficial de sete dias no Brasil pela morte do papa Francisco na manhã desta segunda. Por volta das 10h, as bandeiras em frente ao Palácio do Planalto e ao Supremo Tribunal Federal já eram hasteadas a meio-mastro – símbolo do luto nos prédios públicos.
Veja como foi o convívio dos presidentes do Brasil com papa Francisco:

Relação de Lula com papa Francisco
O presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) e a primeira-dama Janja irão ao funeral do papa Francisco em Roma, informou o Palácio do Planalto nesta segunda-feira (21).
A comitiva completa deve ser anunciada nesta terça-feira (22), de acordo com o governo. A viagem ainda não tem data confirmada, dependendo do protocolo do Vaticano, segundo a Secretaria de Comunicação Social da Presidência (Secom).
Lula e Janja irão ao funeral do papa Francisco em Roma, informa Planalto
Lula se reuniu com o papa Francisco por algumas vezes. Em 2020, antes de ser candidato ao terceiro mandato como presidente, Lula e Francisco abordaram temas como fome, desigualdade social e intolerância na conversa com o pontífice.
Em 2023, já como presidente, Lula se reuniu com o papa ao lado da primeira-dama Janja da Silva. Eles discutiram temas como a guerra na Ucrânia, mudanças climáticas e combate à fome.
No ano seguinte, os dois voltaram a se reunir durante visita de Lula à Itália para a cúpula do G7. Lula, mais uma vez acompanhado da primeira-dama Janja, discutiu com Francisco temas como paz mundial, combate à fome e redução das desigualdades. Ele também expressou o desejo de convidar o pontífice para a COP 30 em Belém, em 2025.
A primeira-dama Janja da Silva também se encontrou com o papa Francisco no Vaticano em fevereiro. Durante a visita, o pontífice perguntou sobre a saúde do presidente Lula e expressou seu apoio à Aliança Global Contra a Fome e a Pobreza, uma iniciativa do governo brasileiro.

Em uma rede social, Janja mencionou estar muito emocionada e agradeceu pelas orações do papa pela recuperação de Lula.
Duas semanas depois, Lula e Janja realizaram uma missa na capela do Palácio da Alvorada pela saúde do papa Francisco, que à época, estava internado para tratar uma dupla pneumonia. A missa foi conduzida por três padres jesuítas e contou com a presença de Dom Raymundo Damasceno, Cardeal e Arcebispo Emérito de Aparecida.
Bolsonaro teve relação distante de Francisco
Jair Bolsonaro e o papa Francisco tiveram divergências em temas sociais e ambientais. Durante seu mandato, Bolsonaro não se encontrou com o pontífice, mas suas declarações e políticas frequentemente contrastaram com as mensagens públicas do líder da Igreja Católica.
Bolsonaro respondeu a um tweet de Francisco sobre a Amazônia. Bolsonaro afirmou que a Amazônia pertence ao Brasil e disse que o papa não tem conhecimento sobre a realidade da região. Em sua publicação, Francisco pediu a união do mundo em torno da preservação da Amazônia e os direitos das pessoas que vivem na região.
Presidente Bolsonaro rebate comentário do Papa: 'Amazônia é nossa'
Em 2021, o ex-presidente foi à Roma para participar da cúpula do G20, mas não se reuniu com o papa Francisco – que recebeu a visita de outros chefes de Estado como o então presidente dos Estados Unidos, Joe Biden. 
Em 2022, Francisco enviou uma carta a Bolsonaro prestando condolências pela morte da mãe do então presidnete, Olinda Bonturi Bolsonaro. Francisco disse que Olinda teve um “belo testemunho cristão, tanto no desempenho da sua missão familiar como na solícita colaboração prestada à vida eclesial”.
Bolsonaro lamentou a morte de Francisco e disse que ""a figura do papa sempre foi sinal de unidade, esperança e orientação moral"".
A ex-primeira-dama Michelle Bolsonaro não chegou a se reunir de forma reservada com Francisco, mas participou de um encontro com o pontífice em 2019, em Roma, durante uma reunião com um grupo de primeiras-damas latino-americanas.
Dilma foi primeira lídere recebida pelo papa
A ex-presidente Dilma Rousseff teve alguns encontros significativos com o papa Francisco durante seu mandato e após sua saída da Presidência da República. 
O primeiro encontro ocorreu logo após a missa inaugural do pontífice em 2013, quando Dilma foi a primeira chefe de Estado a ser recebida pelo papa argentino após a cerimônia que deu início ao pontificado.

Baiano encontrado na Costa Rica após três anos diz que fez 'bicos' para se sustentar e teve apoio de outros imigrantes

O baiano que foi deportado da Costa Rica, após entrar ilegalmente no país, disse que fez ''bicos'' para se sustentar durante os três anos que esteve longe de casa, como lavar carros e realizar pequenos serviços em uma borracharia. Ele contou também que teve ajuda de outros imigrantes, de quem recebeu abrigo em alguns momentos, e passou por pelo menos outras seis nações levando apenas a Carteira Nacional de Habilitação (CNH).
Marisvaldo dos Santos Silva conversou com o g1 em Salvador, com exclusividade, pouco depois de retornar para a família. A deportação aconteceu no domingo (20), após o baiano ser flagrado sem documentação adequada no país.
O homem chegou no Brasil por Guarulhos (SP) e seguiu, sozinho, para a capital baiana, onde foi recepcionado pela mãe. Marisvaldo dos Santos estava sumido desde junho de 2022, quando saiu da casa do irmão, em Camaçari, cidade na Região Metropolitana de Salvador (RMS), para pedalar.
Mas não foi só de bicicleta que o homem viajou. Segundo ele, barcos e ônibus também o ajudaram a se deslocar entre os países que percorreu. O baiano conta que o último ponto que esteve no Brasil antes de partir para o exterior foi Roraima. 
Ainda conforme Marisvaldo, de lá, ele seguiu para a Venezuela, passando também por Colômbia, Panamá e Guatemala, até o México, onde ficou a maior parte do tempo e chegou a estar em um relacionamento. 
Há cerca de dois anos, o baiano conta que conseguiu entrar ilegalmente nos Estados Unidos, porém foi deportado, voltando para o México. Depois, conforme relatou, ele seguiu para Costa Rica, até que foi pego.

De volta à terra natal, Marisvaldo contou que nesses três anos não entrou em contato com os familiares para não preocupar ninguém.
""Como toda família, temos nossos desafios e temos que lutar, tentar apagar as coisas do passado, tentar criar um futuro melhor. Mas eu estou muito feliz"", contou. 
O sentimento é compartilhado pela mãe do baiano, mas ainda há preocupação. Maria dos Santos contou que o filho não aceita o diagnóstico de esquizofrenia e, por isso, não recebe acompanhamento médico adequado, e nem usa os medicamentos necessários. 
""Eu estou bem, estou feliz que ele está de volta depois desses três anos. Minha vida era chorar, ficar preocupada, mas, graças a Deus, ele voltou. Vai ficar comigo, com meu cuidado. Não imagino como foram esses anos"". 
Reencontro
Baiano encontrado na Costa Rica revê mãe em Salvador após três anos desaparecido
Marisvaldo dos Santos reviu a mãe, na madrugada de segunda-feira (21), depois de três anos longe de casa. Ele foi recepcionado no Aeroporto Internacional de Salvador por familiares, que buscavam pelo paradeiro dele desde o desaparecimento.
Em um vídeo feito pela família para o g1, o baiano e a mãe, Maria dos Santos, se abraçam, enquanto ela comemora o reencontro: ""Estou tão feliz que meu filho apareceu depois de três anos desaparecido. Só Jesus mesmo"", disse.
Conforme informou a mãe de Marisvaldo, nesse primeiro momento, ele ficará na casa dela, no bairro de Pernambués, na capital baiana. Depois, o baiano deve seguir para um imóvel onde ele chegou a morar antes de desaparecer, na mesma região.
Inicialmente, o homem chegaria à terra natal de ônibus, porque, segundo a família, as passagens estavam caras e eles não teriam condições de arcar com o custo. 
No entanto, os familiares de Marisvaldo conseguiram parcelar o valor no cartão de crédito e encurtaram a viagem. Na estrada, o percurso passaria de um dia e meio de viagem. De avião, foi de menos de três horas.
Esta não é a primeira vez que ele desaparece. Em 2020, no início da pandemia da Covid-19, o homem saiu de bicicleta e só foi localizado dias depois no Espírito Santo. O fato de ter esquizofrenia e não estar tomando a medicação pode ter sido o motivo para que saísse de casa mais uma vez, acredita a mãe.

Jornal Nacional/ Reprodução
A Primeira Turma do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) vai começar a analisar, na próxima terça-feira (22), a denúncia da Procuradoria-Geral da República contra outros seis acusados de participação na tentativa de golpe de Estado em 2022.
São eles:
Fernando de Sousa Oliveira, delegado da Polícia Federal (PF) e ex-secretário-executivo da Secretaria de Segurança Pública (SSP)
Marcelo Costa Câmara, coronel da reserva do Exército e ex-assessor do ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro
Filipe Garcia Martins Pereira, ex-assessor especial de Assuntos Internacionais de Bolsonaro
Marília Ferreira de Alencar, ex-diretora de Inteligência do Ministério da Justiça na gestão de Anderson Torres
Mário Fernandes, ex-número dois da Secretaria-Geral da Presidência, general da reserva e homem de confiança de Bolsonaro
Silvinei Vasques, ex-diretor-geral da Polícia Rodoviária Federal (PRF)
O colegiado vai avaliar se o pedido deve ser admitido, ou seja, se deve ser aberta uma ação penal.
Processo que tem Bolsonaro e sete aliados réus por tentativa de golpe de Estado já tem os próximos passos definidos
O grupo é acusado de cinco crimes. Dois deles estão em uma lei que combate os ataques à democracia. Da forma como estão previstos na legislação, a tentativa de deposição do governo já é suficiente para a configuração da ação ilegal. 
Ou seja, na prática, já é possível punir a tentativa de atacar as instituições, mesmo que a ruptura do regime democrático não tenha se concretizado.
Os crimes são:
abolição violenta do Estado Democrático de Direito: pune o ato de ""tentar, com emprego de violência ou grave ameaça, abolir o Estado Democrático de Direito, impedindo ou restringindo o exercício dos poderes constitucionais"". A pena varia de 4 a 8 anos de prisão.
golpe de Estado: fica configurado quando uma pessoa tenta ""depor, por meio de violência ou grave ameaça, o governo legitimamente constituído"". A punição é a prisão, no período de 4 a 12 anos.
O grupo também é acusado de:
organização criminosa: quando quatro ou mais pessoas se reúnem, de forma ordenada e com divisão de tarefas, para cometer crimes. Pena de 3 a 8 anos.
dano qualificado: destruir, inutilizar ou deteriorar coisa alheia, com violência e grave ameaça, contra o patrimônio da União, e com considerável prejuízo para a vítima. Pena de seis meses a três anos.
deterioração de patrimônio tombado: destruir, inutilizar ou deteriorar bem especialmente protegido por lei, ato administrativo ou decisão judicial. Pena de um a três anos.
Lei que protege a democracia
Projeto que revoga Lei de Segurança Nacional inclui novos crimes contra a democracia; entenda
Os dois primeiros delitos foram incluídos na legislação penal pela lei que protege o Estado Democrático de Direito, aprovada em 2021 e assinada pelo próprio ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro.
Como o objetivo da regra é proteger o funcionamento das instituições democráticas, já criminalizam o próprio ato de usar de violência ou ameaça para tentar subverter a ordem. Não exigem que o golpe tenha se concretizado para que a punição seja aplicada.
Isso acontece porque, se ocorre uma ruptura violenta, o Estado Democrático de Direito deixa de existir. Assim, as forças democráticas que foram derrotadas não teriam como promover a responsabilização dos infratores.
Neste caso, os próprios infratores, ao se consolidarem no poder, podem mudar as regras até então estabelecidas no regime democrático anterior para evitar punições.
Análise da denúncia
Neste primeiro momento, a Primeira Turma do STF verifica se a denúncia pode ser admitida, ou seja, se ela tem elementos mínimos que apontam que os delitos foram praticados e que os autores são os acusados.
Se a denúncia receber o aval para tramitar, abre-se um processo penal em que serão ouvidas as partes e colhidas provas.
Encerrada esta etapa, o caso segue para julgamento. Será neste momento que os ministros vão avaliar se o grupo deve ser punido ou não. E, se houver condenação, o tamanho da pena.

Bruno Miani/A Tribuna Jornal
Jorge Mario Bergoglio nasceu e viveu a maior parte de sua vida em Buenos Aires, onde construiu uma carreira eclesiástica marcada pelo serviço aos mais pobres. Tornou-se padre e cardeal até que, em março de 2013, foi eleito para o cargo mais alto da Igreja Católica. Na história, foi o primeiro pontífice latino-americano, o primeiro jesuíta e o primeiro a adotar o nome Francisco. 
Em 12 anos de papado, Francisco promoveu uma modernização dentro da Igreja. Avaliado por muitos como um líder progressista, se posicionou sempre pelos mais vulneráveis, discursou contra guerras e contra a desigualdade social e trabalhou para abrir portas a mulheres e pessoas da comunidade LGBTQIA+.  
A trajetória do Santo Padre à frente do Vaticano se encerrou nesta segunda-feira (21). Ele morreu aos 88 anos, vítima de um AVC e de insuficiência cardíaca, um dia depois de dar a benção aos fiéis durante a missa de Páscoa, na Praça São Pedro. Entre fevereiro e março, o Papa já havia ficado 38 dias internado com pneumonia nos dois pulmões. 
Neste episódio especial, Natuza fala com Gerson Camarotti, comentarista da TV Globo e da GloboNews, sobre a vida e o legado do papa. Autor do livro ""Segredos do Conclave"", Camarotti relembra como foi a escolha de Bergoglio para o papado e diz o que esperar do próximo líder da Igreja Católica. 
Participa também Filipe Domingues, doutor em ciências sociais pela Pontifícia Universidade Gregoriana e diretor do Lay Centre, uma residência em Roma para alunos das universidades católicas. Ele conta como foram os últimos momentos do Papa Francisco.

Stefano Rellandin/Reuters
Vários rituais e cerimônias tradicionais da Igreja Católica estão previstos para acontecer nos próximos dias em celebração ao papa Francisco, morto aos 88 anos nesta segunda-feira (21). Entre os ritos que já ocorreram, está a quebra do Anel do Pescador, ou seja, o anel papal.
O Anel do Pescador
Cada papa usa um anel feito sob medida com a imagem gravada de um homem pescando de um barco, uma referência ao evangelho de Mateus, onde Jesus chama São Pedro de “pescador de homens”.
Esse Anel do Pescador, com o nome do papa gravado sobre a imagem, poderia ser usado como selo em documentos oficiais. O camerlengo quebra o anel e destrói o selo com um martelo ou outro instrumento, para impedir que outra pessoa o use.

O anel de Francisco foi quebrado após seus aposentos serem selados, na tarde desta segunda. Esse é outro rito — no caso, para vetar o acesso aos locais até a eleição de um novo pontífice. 
Geralmente, o Anel do Pescador é usado na mão direita do papa em seu dedo anelar. O acessório é tradicionalmente feito de ouro, mas Francisco usava um anel de prata banhado a ouro, por escolha própria.
O papa Francisco terá uma última homenagem na manhã desta quarta-feira (23), com fiéis velando seu corpo na Basílica de São Pedro. Seu caixão ficará ali por três dias seguidos para, depois, ser levado até à Basílica Santa Maria Maggiore, onde será enterrado.

A denúncia da Procuradoria-Geral da República atribui cinco crimes aos acusados de envolvimento na tentativa de golpe de Estado em 2022. 
Nesta semana, a Primeira Turma do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) começa a decidir se torna réus outros seis envolvidos na suposta trama golpista. O chamado ""núcleo 2"" da organização é acusado de realizar o gerenciamento das ações ilícitas.
Fazem parte deste grupo:

Mário Fernandes, ex-número dois da Secretaria-Geral da Presidência, general da reserva e homem de confiança de Bolsonaro
Silvinei Vasques, ex-diretor-geral da Polícia Rodoviária Federal (PRF)
Processo que tem Bolsonaro e sete aliados réus por tentativa de golpe de Estado já tem os próximos passos definidos
Se a acusação for aceita pelo colegiado, um processo penal será aberto para verificar o grau de participação de cada um nos delitos.
Dos cinco crimes, três estão previstos no Código Penal. O quarto está em uma lei de 2013 e o quinto, em uma norma de 1998.
O g1 detalha o que prevê a legislação sobre as condutas e as penas:
abolição violenta do Estado Democrático de Direito: acontece quando alguém tenta ""com emprego de violência ou grave ameaça, abolir o Estado Democrático de Direito, impedindo ou restringindo o exercício dos poderes constitucionais"". A pena varia de 4 a 8 anos de prisão.
golpe de Estado: fica configurado quando uma pessoa tenta ""depor, por meio de violência ou grave ameaça, o governo legitimamente constituído"". A punição é prisão, no período de 4 a 12 anos.
organização criminosa: quando quatro ou mais pessoas se reúnem, de forma ordenada e com divisão de tarefas, para cometer crimes. Pena de 3 a 8 anos.
dano qualificado: destruir, inutilizar ou deteriorar coisa alheia, com violência e grave ameaça, contra o patrimônio da União, e com considerável prejuízo para a vítima. Pena de seis meses a três anos.
deterioração de patrimônio tombado: destruir, inutilizar ou deteriorar bem especialmente protegido por lei, ato administrativo ou decisão judicial. Pena de um a três anos.
A proposta da PGR é que o grupo seja condenado à prisão e que as penas dos delitos sejam somadas. Ou seja, considerando as punições máximas previstas nas regras penais, as penas podem chegar a, pelo menos, 36 anos.
No entanto, esta definição só vai ocorrer se houver um processo penal e, ao final, julgamento pela condenação do grupo. 
Neste ponto, caberá ao Supremo fixar a pena de cada um, de forma individual. Assim, avaliando as circunstâncias do caso, os ministros podem verificar situações que agravam ou atenuam a punição.",https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2025/04/22/saiba-quais-crimes-a-pgr-atribui-aos-acusados-de-tentativa-de-golpe-e-as-possiveis-penas.ghtml,pt

O que diz a PGR: participou, junto com Marília de Alencar e Silvinei Vasques, das ações de coordenação das forças de segurança com a intenção de manter Jair Bolsonaro no poder, de forma irregular.
Segundo as apurações, Sousa fazia parte de um grupo de aplicativos de mensagens em que os integrantes trataram da elaboração dos dados sobre os resultados eleitorais do primeiro turno de 2022 – a análise sobre locais onde o presidente Lula venceu e o ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro perdeu. O material seria usado para direcionar a atuação da Polícia Rodoviária Federal no bloqueio para evitar que eleitores do petista chegassem às seções eleitorais.
Perícia dos investigadores no celular do delegado localizou diálogos sobre ações da PRF ""que reforçam o comportamento doloso dos denunciados"".

O que diz a PGR: de acordo com o Ministério Público, ""apresentou e sustentou o projeto de decreto que implementaria medidas excepcionais no país"", ou seja, atuou na elaboração do decreto que formalizaria a ruptura democrática.
Em novembro de 2022, teve reunião com o ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro no Palácio da Alvorada para tratar dos termos da norma.
Segundo Mauro Cid, Bolsonaro recebeu das mãos dele ""a minuta de decreto que detalhava diversos 'considerandos' (fundamentos dos atos a serem implementados), apontando supostas interferências do Poder Judiciário no Poder Executivo e decretando, no final, a realização de novas eleições. [A minuta] Impunha também a prisão de autoridades, entre elas os Ministros do STF Alexandre de Moraes e Gilmar Mendes e o Presidente do Senado Rodrigo Pacheco"".

O que diz a PGR: atuou nas medidas de coordenação de policiais para sustentar Jair Bolsonaro no poder, mesmo que de forma irregular. Contou com o apoio de Silvinei Vasques e Fernando de Sousa Oliveira.
Neste contexto, coletou dados dos resultados eleitorais do primeiro turno do pleito de 2022. A ideia era usar as informações para saber em que locais o presidente Lula obteve expressiva e, em contrapartida, o ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro havia sido derrotado.
""A ferramenta figurava como elemento crucial na execução do plano de manutenção de Jair Bolsonaro no poder, uma vez que visava a reverter o favoritismo do oponente, percebido, tanto pelos resultados do primeiro turno quanto pelas pesquisas de intenção de voto no segundo turno"", afirmou a PGR.

O que diz a PGR: junto com Marcelo Costa Câmara, foi ""responsável por coordenar as ações de monitoramento e neutralização de autoridades públicas"". Também fez interlocução com lideranças populares ligadas aos atos antidemocráticos de 8 de janeiro.
Investigadores encontraram em um disco rígido de computador vinculado a ele o ""Plano Punhal Verde e Amarelo"", a trama para assassinar o presidente Lula, o vice Geraldo Alckmin e o ministro Alexandre de Moraes.
Segundo Mauro Cid, o material foi impresso no Palácio do Planalto e, na sequência, Fernandes teria seguido para o Palácio da Alvorada para apresentar o documento ao ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro.
Há também registros de presença de Fernandes, em novembro de 2022, no acampamento montado em frente ao Quartel General do Exército, em Brasília, por simpatizantes de Bolsonaro.

O que diz a PGR: junto com Marília de Alencar e Fernando de Sousa Oliveira, coordenou o uso das forças policiais para sustentar ""a permanência ilegítima de Jair Messias Bolsonaro no poder"".
Também direcionou os recursos da Polícia Rodoviária Federal para garantir a permanência do ex-presidente no poder.
Com este objetivo, participou, ainda, de reunião com o então ministro Anderson Torres para tratar do ""policiamento direcionado"", o bloqueio de rodovias para impedir que simpatizantes do presidente Lula chegassem às urnas.
Crimes
A PGR atribuiu ao grupo cinco crimes:
abolição violenta do Estado Democrático de Direito: pune o ato de ""tentar, com emprego de violência ou grave ameaça, abolir o Estado Democrático de Direito, impedindo ou restringindo o exercício dos poderes constitucionais"". A pena varia de 4 a 8 anos de prisão;
golpe de Estado: fica configurado quando uma pessoa tenta ""depor, por meio de violência ou grave ameaça, o governo legitimamente constituído"". A punição é aplicada por prisão, no período de 4 a 12 anos;
organização criminosa: quando quatro ou mais pessoas se reúnem, de forma ordenada e com divisão de tarefas, para cometer crimes. Pena de 3 a 8 anos;
dano qualificado: destruir, inutilizar ou deteriorar coisa alheia, com violência e grave ameaça, contra o patrimônio da União, e com considerável prejuízo para a vítima. Pena de seis meses a três anos;

O presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) recebe nesta terça-feira (22) o presidente do Chile, Gabriel Boric, para uma visita de Estado. Após o encontro no Palácio do Planalto, as autoridades seguem para o Palácio Itamaraty, onde participam de almoço.
A reunião busca consolidar as relações bilaterais entre os dois países, com foco em comércio, investimentos e a conclusão do Corredor Rodoviário Bioceânico. 
A relação entre Lula e Boric tem sido marcada por cooperação, apesar de divergências pontuais sobre questões internacionais (veja o vídeo abaixo e leia mais sobre isso aqui).

A visita de Estado marca as comemorações do primeiro Dia da Amizade entre os dois países. O 22 de abril é a data em que as relações diplomáticas entre Brasil e Chile foram estabelecidas, em 1836.
Além da reunião bilateral e do almoço, os presidentes devem participar Foro Empresarial Brasil-Chile, onde serão discutidos temas estratégicos para a integração logística e comercial entre as duas nações. 
A visita também contará com a presença de ministros, parlamentares, outros políticos e empresários chilenos, reforçando o compromisso de ambos os países em aprofundar os laços econômicos e políticos.

Enquanto Lula tem adotado uma postura mais conciliadora e crítica às sanções impostas pelos Estados Unidos ao governo de Nicolás Maduro, Boric tem sido um crítico das violações de direitos humanos na Venezuela.

Francisco morreu aos 88 anos na segunda-feira (21). O Vaticano informou que o papa sofreu um Acidente Vascular Cerebral (AVC), seguido de um quadro de insuficiência cardíaca irreversível.
Nos próximos dias, a Igreja Católica deve realizar uma série de cerimônias para se despedir de Francisco. Os ritos são divididos em três etapas, que vão desde a preparação do corpo até o enterro.
A primeira etapa foi feita ainda na segunda-feira, quando a Igreja confirmou oficialmente a morte do papa e selou os aposentos papais.
Nas próximas horas, o corpo de Francisco deve ser vestido com batina branca e vestes vermelhas e colocado em um caixão de madeira simples. A urna funerária será levada em procissão até a Basílica de São Pedro, onde ficará exposta por três dias.
O Vaticano anunciou que o corpo do papa será levado à basílica na manhã de quarta-feira (23). A partir desse dia, os fiéis poderão prestar as últimas homenagens.
Após a exposição pública, um pano branco será colocado sobre o rosto de Francisco. Em seguida, será celebrada uma missa fúnebre, com uma homilia sobre a vida e a espiritualidade do papa.
Depois da missa, o corpo será levado em procissão por Roma até a Basílica de Santa Maria Maggiore, onde será sepultado.

Papa simplificou funeral

Remo Casilli/Reuters
Francisco aprovou uma reforma que simplificou os rituais funerários de pontífices cinco meses antes de morrer. Uma das alterações permite que o sepultamento dos papas ocorra fora do Vaticano, atendendo ao desejo de Francisco de ser enterrado na Basílica de Santa Maria Maggiore. 
A reforma também eliminou a exigência de três caixões tradicionais — de cipreste, chumbo e carvalho. Agora, a urna terá apenas uma estrutura de madeira revestida por zinco.
A simplificação, segundo o mestre de cerimônias litúrgicas do Vaticano, monsenhor Diego Ravelli, visa ""enfatizar ainda mais que o funeral do Romano Pontífice é o de um pastor e discípulo de Cristo, e não de um homem poderoso deste mundo"".
Além disso, também foi eliminada a exigência de que o papa seja colocado em um caixão elevado na Basílica de São Pedro para exibição pública.

Durante os dias de eleição, cardeais do mundo todo ficam fechados dentro do Vaticano, em uma área conhecida como ""zona de Conclave"". Eles também fazem um juramento de segredo absoluto sobre o processo.
Atualmente, 135 cardeais com menos de 80 anos estão aptos a participar da eleição, sendo sete brasileiros. Veja a seguir:
Leonardo Ulrich Steiner, arcebispo de Manaus, 74 anos.
João Braz de Aviz, arcebispo emérito de Brasília, 77 anos.
Paulo Cezar Costa, arcebispo de Brasília, 57 anos.
Orani Tempesta, arcebispo do Rio de Janeiro, 74 anos.
Odilo Scherer, arcebispo de São Paulo, 75 anos.
Jaime Spengler, presidente da CNBB e arcebispo de Porto Alegre, 64 anos.
Sérgio da Rocha, Primaz do Brasil e arcebispo de Salvador, 65 anos.
Todos os cardeais que participam da eleição ficam impedidos de utilizar qualquer meio de comunicação com o exterior. Ou seja, eles não podem usar telefones, ler jornais ou conversar com pessoas de fora do Vaticano. Essas medidas foram adotadas para evitar que a votação seja influenciada.
As votações acontecem dentro da famosa Capela Sistina. Para ser eleito, um cardeal precisa receber dois terços dos votos que — são secretos e queimados após a contagem.
Ao todo, até quatro votações podem ser realizadas diariamente, sendo duas pela manhã e duas à tarde. Se, depois do terceiro dia de conclave, a Igreja continuar sem papa, uma pausa de 24 horas é feita para orações. Outra pausa pode ser convocada após mais sete votações sem um eleito.
Caso haja 34 votações sem consenso, os dois mais votados da última rodada disputarão uma espécie de ""segundo turno"". Ainda assim, será necessário atingir dois terços dos votos para que um deles seja eleito.
Quando um cardeal é eleito, a Igreja questiona se ele aceita o cargo de papa. Se ele concordar, o religioso também precisa escolher um nome. Em seguida, ele é levado para um ambiente conhecido como ""Sala das Lágrimas"", onde veste as vestes papais.
Por fim, o novo papa é anunciado à multidão que aguarda na Praça de São Pedro. O pontífice é apresentado diretamente da sacada da Basílica, onde é proclamada a famosa frase ""Habemus Papam"" (""Temos um Papa"").

QUEM PODE SUBSTITUIR FRANCISCO? Veja nomes cotados
Veja o glossário das expressões comuns da sucessão do papa:
Papa Francisco
Divulgação/Vaticano News
Camerlengo: cardeal que assume, de forma interina, as funções do papa entre a morte do pontífice e a eleição do sucessor. É ele quem define as datas das cerimônias fúnebres e convoca o conclave. Atualmente, o cargo é ocupado pelo cardeal Kevin Joseph Farrell.
Conclave: ritual em que o Colégio dos Cardeais se reúne, no Vaticano, para eleger o novo líder da Igreja Católica. A palavra ""conclave"" vem do latim cum clavis e significa ""fechado à chave"". 
''Eligo in summum pontificem'': frase inscrita no boletim de papel em que os cardeais escrevem seus votos. Quer dizer ""elejo como Sumo Pontífice"", em latim. 
Escrutinadores: cardeais encarregados de contar os votos no conclave.
Fumaça: fumaça que sai da chaminé na Capela Sistina e indica se o conclave foi concluído. A fumaça preta indica que ainda não há uma definição; já a branca anuncia que há um novo papa. 
Habemus Papam: texto lido pelo cardeal protodiácono para anunciar a eleição de um novo papa. O anúncio é feito na varanda central da Basílica de São Pedro e, em seguida, o novo papa dá a sua primeira benção Urbi et Orbi. 
Infirmarii: cardeais que levam cédulas de votação aos cardeais doentes, que não podem comparecer à Capela Sistina. 
Revisores: cardeais responsáveis pela revisão da contagem de votos no conclave.
Protodiácono: cardeal mais velho da ordem dos Cardeais-Diáconos, tem a função de revelar ao público quem é o novo papa. O atual protodiácono, que irá anunciar o próximo pontífice, é o cardeal francês Dominique Mamberti.
Sé vacante: período em que o ""trono"" ou a cadeira de uma Igreja está sem ocupante, ou seja, a Catedral está sem líder. No caso da Santa Sé, ela é considerada vacante no período entre a morte ou renúncia de um papa e a eleição de um sucessor. 
Como funciona a escolha para o novo papa?
A escolha do novo líder da Igreja Católica começa entre 15 e 20 dias após a morte do papa. Durante esse período, o Vaticano convoca o chamado Colégio dos Cardeais, com religiosos do mundo inteiro. Atualmente, 252 cardeais integram esse grupo, incluindo oito brasileiros.
E, desse grupo, 135 cardeais com menos de 80 anos estão aptos a participar da eleição do novo papa, sendo sete brasileiros.
Todos os cardeais que participam da eleição ficam impedidos de utilizar qualquer meio de comunicação com o exterior. Ou seja, eles não podem usar telefones, ler jornais ou conversar com pessoas de fora do Vaticano. Essas medidas foram adotadas para evitar que a votação seja influenciada.
As votações acontecem dentro da famosa Capela Sistina. Para ser eleito, um cardeal precisa receber dois terços dos votos que são secretos e queimados após a contagem.

Ao todo, até quatro votações podem ser realizadas diariamente, sendo duas pela manhã e duas à tarde. Se, depois do terceiro dia de conclave, a Igreja continuar sem papa, uma pausa de 24 horas é feita para orações. Outra pausa pode ser convocada após mais sete votações sem um eleito.
Caso haja 34 votações sem consenso, os dois mais votados da última rodada disputarão uma espécie de ""segundo turno"". Ainda assim, será necessário atingir dois terços dos votos para que um deles seja eleito.
Quando um cardeal é eleito, a Igreja questiona se ele aceita o cargo de papa. Se ele concordar, o religioso também precisa escolher um nome. Em seguida, ele é levado para um ambiente conhecido como ""Sala das Lágrimas"", onde veste as vestes papais.
Por fim, o novo papa é anunciado à multidão que aguarda na Praça de São Pedro. O pontífice é apresentado diretamente da sacada da Basílica, onde é proclamada a famosa frase ""Habemus Papam"" (""Temos um Papa"").

Circuito registra momento em Wanderson Honorato é atacado
A polícia procura pelo suspeito de matar um entregador, de 24 anos, com uma facada no pescoço na tarde de sábado (20), na Avenida Raja Gabaglia, na Região Oeste de Belo Horizonte.  Segundo a família, o crime aconteceu depois de uma discussão entre o irmão da vítima e outro entregador, que também prestava serviço para um supermercado online.
Imagens de uma câmera de segurança registraram o momento em Wanderson Honorato Ferraz é atingido pelo golpe (veja vídeo acima). Ele trabalhava como entregador e morreu em frente à central de distribuição do supermercado.
O pai de Wanderson, Paulo Ferraz,  pede que o suspeito seja localizado e a justiça seja feita. 
“Deus há de fazer justiça pra mim, porque ele era um filho maravilhoso. Trabalhador, cheio de sonhos, muito unido ao irmão. Esse cara interrompeu o sonho do meu filho”.

Desentendimento
De acordo com familiares, a confusão começou mais cedo, quando o irmão da vítima, o também entregador Washington Ferraz, se desentendeu com o suspeito do crime, Danilo Assunção Carvalho de Paula, de 23 anos, por causa da ordem de chegada dos entregadores na plataforma. 
Segundo Washington, Danilo era novo no trabalho e não gostou de receber orientações sobre as regras adotadas pelos demais colegas.
“A gente brigou por ordem de chegada, uma regra que a gente tinha na casa há muito tempo. Como esse Danilo era novato, a gente estava repassando as regras pra ele e ele se exaltou. Depois que os meninos separaram a briga, eu saí pra fazer uma entrega e achei que tinha ficado por isso mesmo”, contou Washington.

Wanderson teria ido até o local para entender o que tinha acontecido com o irmão, quando foi atacado com uma facada no pescoço. “Meu irmão não tinha nada a ver com isso. Foi uma covardia. Era um menino bom, honesto, não conheço uma pessoa que não gostasse dele”, disse Washington.
Após o crime, Danilo fugiu do local de moto e, até a publicação desta edição, ainda não havia sido localizado. A empresa responsável pela plataforma de entregas informou que está colaborando com as investigações, prestando apoio à família da vítima e que bloqueou o suspeito no sistema.
O corpo de Wanderson foi enterrado no domingo (20), no Cemitério da Consolação, na Região Norte de Belo Horizonte. A Polícia Civil informou que investiga as causas e as circunstâncias do assassinato.

Antes de morrer, Francisco fez mudanças para simplificar rituais fúnebres. Entenda como será o funeral do papa Francisco
A morte de um papa dá início a uma série de ritos e cerimônias cuidadosamente organizadas muito antes do início do Conclave para eleger o sucessor. Elas envolvem a certificação da morte e a exibição pública do corpo para que os fiéis possam prestar homenagens, além do funeral e do sepultamento.
O papa Francisco, que morreu nesta segunda-feira (21), revisou diversos ritos no ano passado, simplificando os rituais funerários para enfatizar seu papel como um simples bispo. Ele manifestou as suas preferências em um testamento.

Mas os elementos centrais permanecem, incluindo três momentos-chave que devem ser observados entre a morte de um papa e seu sepultamento. Veja mais abaixo cada um deles.
Embora os papas frequentemente façam ajustes nas regras que regulam o Conclave, uma revisão dos ritos funerários papais não era feita desde o ano 2000. As mudanças se tornaram necessárias após Francisco expressar seus próprios desejos.
Em 2023, alguns meses depois da morte de Bento XVI, Francisco revelou que estava trabalhando com o mestre de cerimônias litúrgicas do Vaticano, o arcebispo Diego Ravelli, para reformular completamente o livro de ritos e simplificá-los.
Ao explicar as reformas, Ravelli afirmou que as mudanças tinham como objetivo “enfatizar ainda mais que o funeral do Pontífice Romano é o de um pastor e discípulo de Cristo, e não o de um homem poderoso deste mundo”.

Confira a seguir as etapas do funeral do papa.
1. Preparação do corpo
Papa Francisco morre aos 88 anos
Vaticano
Os ritos fúnebres ocorrem em três partes, chamadas de estações. A primeira ocorre na capela privada do papa, após profissionais de saúde confirmarem a morte. Até recentemente, essa etapa acontecia ao lado da cama do papa.
Após o corpo repousar na capela, o cardeal que atua como camerlengo organizará o funeral. Ele também é responsável por administrar o Vaticano até que um novo papa seja eleito. O atual camerlengo é o cardeal Kevin Joseph Farrell, nomeado por Francisco em 2019.
Como ocorre há séculos, o camerlengo chama formalmente o papa falecido pelo nome completo que recebeu no batismo — Jorge Mario Bergoglio. 
Tradicionalmente, outro rito antigo também acontece após a declaração da morte do papa: a destruição do anel papal. Cada papa usa um anel feito sob medida com a imagem gravada de um homem pescando de um barco, uma referência ao evangelho de Mateus, onde Jesus chama São Pedro de “pescador de homens”. 
Esse Anel do Pescador, com o nome do papa gravado sobre a imagem, poderia ser usado como selo em documentos oficiais. O camerlengo quebrará o anel de Francisco e destruirá o selo com um martelo ou outro instrumento, para impedir que outra pessoa o use.
Os aposentos papais também serão trancados, com entrada proibida — uma prática tradicional para evitar saques.

2. Velório

O papa será vestido com sua simples batina branca e vestes vermelhas, e colocado em um caixão de madeira simples. Esse caixão será levado em procissão até a Basílica de São Pedro, onde ocorrerá a exposição pública do corpo pelos três dias seguintes. A expectativa é que o velório comece na quarta.
Durante esse período, o corpo do papa ficará em um caixão simples e aberto, para enfatizar o papel humilde do papa como pastor, e não como chefe de Estado. Anteriormente, o corpo ficava sobre uma plataforma elevada chamada catafalco, prática encerrada no funeral do papa Bento XVI, feito em janeiro de 2023.
Bento XVI também foi o último papa a ser enterrado nos tradicionais três caixões — de cipreste, chumbo e olmo. Dois desses caixões continham documentos sobre seu pontificado; o primeiro também abrigava três sacos de moedas — ouro, prata e cobre — representando cada ano de seu pontificado.
No funeral de Francisco, após a exposição pública, um pano branco será colocado sobre seu rosto, enquanto ele repousa no caixão de carvalho — uma tradição que continua nos funerais papais. Mas esta será a primeira vez que apenas um único caixão será utilizado. Provavelmente, conterá um documento descrevendo seu pontificado e um saco de moedas referente ao seu tempo como papa.
A Missa fúnebre será celebrada em São Pedro, provavelmente dentro da basílica, por causa do clima, e é provável que haja uma multidão de fiéis do lado de fora, reunidos na praça. 
A homilia refletirá sobre a vida e espiritualidade do papa falecido. O próprio Francisco fez a homilia no funeral de seu antecessor aposentado, o papa Bento XVI. 
Já Joseph Ratzinger, ainda antes de ser eleito papa Bento XVI, fez a homilia no funeral de João Paulo II. À época, Ratzinger era o líder — ou decano — de todos os altos membros da Igreja, o chamado Colégio dos Cardeais.
O atual decano é o cardeal Giovanni Battista Re, de 91 anos, e não se sabe se ele conseguirá manter essa tradição devido à idade avançada. 
Missas continuarão sendo celebradas em memória de Francisco por nove dias após sua morte — um período chamado de Novendialis. Esse ritual foi inspirado em uma tradição romana antiga que previa um período de luto encerrado no nono dia após a morte.

3. Sepultamento

Papados anteriores foram sepultados em vários locais. Até a legalização do cristianismo no Império Romano, no início do século IV, os papas eram enterrados nas catacumbas, os cemitérios nos arredores de Roma.
Depois disso, os papas passaram a ser enterrados em diferentes locais, como a Basílica de São João de Latrão — a catedral oficial de Roma — ou outras igrejas dentro e fora da cidade. Alguns chegaram a ser sepultados na França, durante o século XIV, quando o papado foi transferido para a fronteira francesa por razões políticas.
A maioria dos papas é enterrada nas grutas sob a Basílica de São Pedro, e desde o sepultamento do papa Leão XIII em São João de Latrão, em 1903, todos os papas foram enterrados em São Pedro. 
No entanto, segundo os desejos de Francisco, deverá haver uma procissão por Roma até Santa Maria Maggiore, com o carro funerário e outros veículos levando as pessoas que participarão desse ritual privado.
Após algumas orações finais e a aspersão de água benta, o caixão será colocado em seu local definitivo dentro da igreja. Apenas mais tarde o espaço será aberto ao público para orações e veneração.

Com a morte do papa Francisco nesta segunda-feira (21), o Vaticano vai começar os preparativos para escolher um novo líder da Igreja Católica. 
Até que isso ocorra, a Igreja terá uma espécie de governo temporário, e as decisões urgentes ficarão a cargo do Colégio dos Cardeais.
A votação para eleger um novo papa, chamada de Conclave, deve começar entre 15 e 20 dias. Estão aptos a participar da eleição 135 cardeais com menos de 80 anos, membros do Colégio, sendo sete brasileiros. 
Entre os cotados para ser o novo papa há perfis diversos: cardeais mais progressistas, entre os quais aliados de Francisco, e também conservadores.

Papa Francisco deixa legado de transformação na Igreja Católica
Veja a seguir alguns nomes que estão sendo cotados para suceder Francisco. 
Jean-Marc Aveline, arcebispo de Marselha, francês, 66 anos
Jean-Marc Aveline, arcebispo de Marselha, francês, 66 anos
Vaticano/Divulgação
Jean-Marc Aveline é conhecido em alguns círculos católicos como João XXIV, em referência à sua semelhança com o papa João XXIII, o papa reformador de rosto redondo do início dos anos 1960.
Aveline é conhecido por sua natureza simples e descontraída, sua facilidade para fazer piadas e sua proximidade ideológica com Francisco, especialmente em relação à imigração e às relações com o mundo muçulmano. 
Ele também é um intelectual sério, com doutorado em teologia e graduação em filosofia.
O arcebispo nasceu na Argélia em uma família de imigrantes espanhóis que se mudaram para a França após a independência da Argélia, e viveu a maior parte de sua vida em Marselha.
Sob o comando de Francisco, Aveline fez grandes progressos na carreira, tornando-se bispo em 2013, arcebispo em 2019 e cardeal três anos depois. Sua posição foi impulsionada em setembro de 2023, quando organizou uma conferência internacional da Igreja sobre questões mediterrâneas, na qual o papa Francisco foi o convidado principal.
Se assumisse o cargo máximo, Aveline se tornaria o primeiro papa francês desde o século XIV, um período turbulento em que o papado se mudou para Avignon. Ele também seria o papa mais jovem desde João Paulo II. 
Cardeal Peter Erdo, húngaro, 72 anos
Cardeal Peter Erdo, húngaro, 72 anos
Vatican News/Divulgação
Erdo já era um candidato papal no último conclave em 2013, graças aos seus amplos contatos com a Igreja na Europa e na África, e por ser visto como um pioneiro do movimento da Nova Evangelização para reacender a fé católica em nações avançadas secularizadas — uma prioridade para muitos cardeais.
Ele é considerado conservador em teologia e, em discursos por toda a Europa, enfatiza as raízes cristãs do continente. No entanto, também é visto como pragmático e nunca entrou em conflito abertamente com Francisco, ao contrário de outros clérigos de mentalidade tradicional.
Apesar disso, Erdo causou surpresa no Vaticano durante a crise migratória de 2015, quando foi contra o apelo do papa Francisco para que as igrejas acolhessem refugiados, dizendo que isso equivaleria a tráfico de pessoas — aparentemente se alinhando com o primeiro-ministro nacionalista da Hungria, Viktor Orban.
Especialista em direito canônico, Erdo teve uma trajetória acelerada durante toda a sua carreira, tornando-se bispo aos 40 anos e cardeal em 2003, quando tinha apenas 51 anos, o que o tornou o membro mais jovem do Colégio dos Cardeais até 2010.

Arquidiocese de Braga/Divulgação
Grech vem de Gozo, uma pequena ilha que faz parte de Malta, o menor país da União Europeia. Partindo de um começo modesto, Grech evoluiu para grandes feitos, sendo nomeado pelo papa Francisco para ser secretário-geral do Sínodo dos Bispos — um cargo de peso dentro do Vaticano.
Inicialmente visto como conservador, Grech se tornou um porta-voz das reformas de Francisco dentro da Igreja durante anos, evoluindo rapidamente com os tempos.
Em 2008, vários cidadãos gays malteses declararam que estavam deixando a Igreja em protesto contra o que viam como uma postura anti-LGBT do então pontífice, o Papa Bento XVI.
Grech demonstrou pouca simpatia na época, mas, falando no Vaticano em 2014, ele pediu que a Igreja fosse mais receptiva aos seus membros LGBT e criativa para encontrar novas maneiras de abordar situações familiares contemporâneas.
No dia seguinte, o papa Francisco deu um tapinha em seu ombro durante o café da manhã e o elogiou pelo discurso, indicando-o para uma futura promoção.
Cardeal Juan Jose Omella, arcebispo de Barcelona, ​​espanhol, 79 anos
Cardeal Juan Jose Omella, arcebispo de Barcelona, ​​espanhol, 79 anos
Vatican News/Divulgação
Modesto e bem-humorado, Omella vive uma vida humilde apesar de seu título elevado, dedicando sua carreira na Igreja ao cuidado pastoral, à promoção da justiça social e à personificação de uma visão compassiva e inclusiva do catolicismo.
""Não devemos ver a realidade apenas pelos olhos daqueles que mais têm, mas também pelos olhos dos pobres"", disse ele ao site de notícias Crux em abril de 2022, em palavras que refletiam a visão de mundo de Francisco.
Nasceu em 1946 na vila de Cretas, no nordeste da Espanha. Após ser ordenado em 1970, serviu como padre em várias paróquias espanholas e também passou um ano como missionário no Zaire, hoje República Democrática do Congo.
Ressaltando sua dedicação a causas sociais, de 1999 a 2015 ele trabalhou em estreita colaboração com a instituição de caridade espanhola Manos Unidas, que combate a fome, as doenças e a pobreza nos países em desenvolvimento.
Ele se tornou bispo em 1996 e foi promovido a arcebispo de Barcelona em 2015. Apenas um ano depois, Francisco lhe deu um barrete cardinalício vermelho — uma atitude vista como um claro endosso às tendências progressistas de Omella, que contrastam com os elementos mais conservadores que antes dominavam a Igreja espanhola.
Cardeal Pietro Parolin, italiano, diplomata do Vaticano, 70 anos
Cardeal Pietro Parolin, italiano, diplomata do Vaticano, 70 anos
Vatican News/Divulgação
Favorito dos apostadores, Parolin foi diplomata da Igreja durante a maior parte de sua vida e serviu como secretário de Estado do papa desde 2013, ano em que Francisco foi eleito.
O cargo é semelhante ao de um primeiro-ministro, e os secretários de Estado são frequentemente chamados de ""vice-papas"" porque estão em segundo lugar, depois do pontífice, na hierarquia do Vaticano.
Parolin atuou anteriormente como vice-ministro das Relações Exteriores do Papa Bento XVI, que em 2009 o nomeou embaixador do Vaticano na Venezuela, onde defendeu a Igreja contra as iniciativas do então presidente Hugo Chávez para enfraquecê-la.
Ele também foi o principal arquiteto da reaproximação do Vaticano com a China e o Vietnã. Conservadores o atacaram por um acordo sobre a nomeação de bispos na China comunista. Ele defendeu o acordo, afirmando que, embora não fosse perfeito, evitou um cisma e proporcionou alguma forma de comunicação com o governo de Pequim.
Parolin nunca foi um ativista de linha de frente ou barulhento nas chamadas Guerras Culturais da Igreja, que se concentravam em questões como aborto e direitos gays, embora ele tenha condenado a legalização do casamento entre pessoas do mesmo sexo em muitos países como ""uma derrota para a humanidade"".
Cardeal Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle, filipino
Cardeal Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle, filipino
Vatican News/Divulgação
Tagle é frequentemente chamado de ""Francisco Asiático"" devido ao seu comprometimento semelhante com a justiça social e, se eleito, seria o primeiro pontífice da Ásia.
No papel, Tagle, que geralmente prefere ser chamado pelo apelido ""Chito"", parece ter todos os requisitos para ser um papa. 
Ele tem décadas de experiência pastoral desde sua ordenação sacerdotal em 1982. Depois, adquiriu experiência administrativa, primeiro como bispo de Imus e depois como arcebispo de Manila.
O Papa Bento XVI o nomeou cardeal em 2012. Em uma ação vista por alguns como uma estratégia de Francisco para dar a Tagle alguma experiência no Vaticano, o papa o transferiu de Manila em 2019 e o nomeou chefe do braço missionário da Igreja, formalmente conhecido como Dicastério para a Evangelização.
Ele vem do que alguns chamam de ""pulmão católico da Ásia"", já que as Filipinas têm a maior população católica da região. Sua mãe era filipina de origem chinesa. 
Cardeal Joseph Tobin, arcebispo de Newark, NJ, americano, 72 anos

Vaticano/Divulgação
É improvável que os cardeais do mundo escolhessem o primeiro papa dos EUA, mas se estivessem dispostos a isso, Tobin pareceria a possibilidade mais provável.
Tobin serviu como segundo em comando de um escritório do Vaticano de 2009 a 2012 e foi então nomeado pelo Papa Bento XVI arcebispo de Indianápolis, Indiana. Francisco o promoveu a cardeal em 2016 e, posteriormente, o nomeou arcebispo de Newark.
Nesta última função, Tobin, um homem grandalhão conhecido por sua rotina de exercícios de levantamento de peso, lidou com um dos escândalos católicos de maior repercussão dos últimos anos. Em 2018, o então Cardeal Theodore McCarrick , um dos antecessores de Tobin em Newark, foi afastado do ministério por acusações de má conduta sexual com seminaristas.
McCarrick, que nega qualquer irregularidade, renunciou ao cargo de cardeal e mais tarde foi considerado culpado por um tribunal do Vaticano e removido do sacerdócio.
Tobin recebeu elogios por sua condução do escândalo, incluindo a decisão de tornar públicos acordos anteriormente confidenciais feitos entre a arquidiocese e as supostas vítimas de McCarrick.
Tobin é o mais velho de 13 irmãos e afirmou ser um alcoólatra em recuperação. Ele é conhecido por sua atitude de abertura em relação às pessoas LGBTQIA+, tendo escrito em 2017 que ""em muitas partes da nossa igreja, pessoas LGBTQIA+ foram levadas a se sentirem indesejadas, excluídas e até mesmo envergonhadas"".
Cardeal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson, ganês, funcionário do Vaticano, 76 anos
Cardeal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson, ganês, funcionário do Vaticano, 76 anos
Vatican News/Divulgação
De origens humildes em uma pequena cidade africana, o Cardeal Peter Turkson alcançou grandes feitos na Igreja, o que o tornou um candidato a se tornar o primeiro papa da África Subsaariana.
Ele combina uma longa experiência pastoral cuidando de congregações em Gana com experiência prática na liderança de vários escritórios do Vaticano, bem como fortes habilidades de comunicação.
O fato de ele vir de uma das regiões mais dinâmicas para a Igreja, que está lutando contra as forças do secularismo em suas terras centrais europeias, também deve reforçar sua posição.
Quarto filho de uma família de 10 filhos, Turkson nasceu em Wassaw Nsuta, na então chamada Costa do Ouro, no Império Britânico. Seu pai trabalhava em uma mina próxima e também era carpinteiro, enquanto sua mãe vendia vegetais no mercado.
Ele estudou em seminários em Gana e Nova York, foi ordenado em 1975 e depois lecionou em seu antigo seminário ganês e fez estudos bíblicos avançados em Roma.
O papa João Paulo II o nomeou arcebispo de Cape Coast em 1992 e 11 anos depois o tornou o primeiro cardeal na história do estado da África Ocidental.
As promoções continuaram sob o sucessor de João Paulo II, Bento XVI, que o levou ao Vaticano em 2009 e o tornou chefe do Pontifício Conselho Justiça e Paz — o órgão que promove a justiça social, os direitos humanos e a paz mundial.
Nessa função, ele foi um dos conselheiros mais próximos do papa em questões como as mudanças climáticas e atraiu muita atenção ao participar de conferências como o fórum econômico de Davos.

Matteo Maria Zuppi, italiano, arcebispo de Bolonha, 69 anos
Vatican News/Divulgação
Quando Zuppi foi promovido em 2015 e se tornou arcebispo de Bolonha, a mídia nacional se referiu a ele como o ""Bergoglio italiano"", devido à sua afinidade com Francisco, o papa argentino que nasceu Jorge Mario Bergoglio.
Zuppi seria o primeiro papa italiano desde 1978.
Assim como o papa Francisco quando morava em Buenos Aires, Zuppi é conhecido como um ""padre de rua"" que se concentra nos migrantes e nos pobres, e pouco se importa com pompa e protocolo. 
Ele atende pelo nome de ""Padre Matteo"" e, em Bolonha, às vezes usa uma bicicleta em vez de um carro oficial.
Se ele fosse eleito papa, os conservadores provavelmente o veriam com desconfiança. Vítimas de abuso sexual na Igreja também poderiam se opor a ele, já que a Igreja Católica Italiana, que ele lidera desde 2022, tem sido lenta em investigar e confrontar a questão.

O anúncio da morte do papa Francisco abalou profundamente a comunidade católica e gerou lamentações em todo o mundo. Jorge Mario Bergoglio, conhecido por seu carisma e pelas reformas que implementou na Igreja Católica, faleceu aos 88 anos nesta segunda-feira (21). 
Segundo o Vaticano, sua morte foi causada por um Acidente Vascular Cerebral (AVC), seguido por outras complicações (saiba mais abaixo).
Os sinos da Basílica de São Pedro tocaram para marcar o momento, mas esse é apenas um dos muitos ritos que acompanham a despedida de um papa. 
A partir de agora, cerimônias cuidadosamente planejadas serão realizadas, e a Igreja Católica passará por eventos que decidirão o seu futuro, como o início do Conclave para eleger o sucessor de Francisco.

Jorge Mario Bergoglio faleceu aos 88 anos na madrugada desta segunda-feira, às 2h35 pelo horário de Brasília (7h35 no horário local). 
Ele estava em seu apartamento na residência de Santa Marta, na Cidade do Vaticano, onde morava desde que foi eleito papa em 2013.
""O Bispo de Roma, Francisco, retornou à casa do Pai. Toda a sua vida foi dedicada ao serviço do Senhor e de Sua Igreja. Ele nos ensinou a viver os valores do Evangelho com fidelidade, coragem e amor universal, especialmente em favor dos mais pobres e marginalizados. Com imensa gratidão por seu exemplo como verdadeiro discípulo do Senhor Jesus, recomendamos a alma do Papa Francisco ao infinito amor misericordioso do Deus Trino"", dizia o comunicado oficial. 
Os sinos da Basílica de São Pedro, no Vaticano, tocaram para anunciar a notícia da morte. 
2. Quais as causas da morte? 
O papa morreu devido a um acidente vascular cerebral (AVC) seguido de insuficiência cardíaca, conforme informou o Vaticano. 
Segundo a certidão médica que atestou a morte, ele sofreu um AVC, entrou em coma e teve um colapso cardiocirculatório irreversível. 
O quadro foi agravado por uma série de problemas de saúde, incluindo uma insuficiência respiratória aguda causada por uma pneumonia multimicrobiana bilateral, bronquiectasias múltiplas, pressão alta e diabetes tipo II.

A morte foi confirmada por um registro eletrocardiotanatográfico. Francisco estava se recuperando de uma pneumonia nos dois pulmões após ter ficado internado por 38 dias. Ele havia recebido alta há um mês e estava sob cuidados médicos.
Francisco foi hospitalizado pela primeira vez no início de fevereiro devido a problemas respiratórios. 
No dia 14 de fevereiro, foi internado no hospital Agostino Gemelli para tratar uma bronquite. Mesmo hospitalizado, participou de algumas atividades religiosas, mas no dia 16 pediu desculpas por não poder participar da oração semanal na Praça de São Pedro.
No dia 17, o Vaticano informou que ele estava com uma infecção polimicrobiana. No dia seguinte, foi anunciado que ele tinha pneumonia bilateral. Francisco recebeu alta no dia 23 de março.

3. Como será o funeral? 
O funeral do papa Francisco segue a ""Ordem das Exéquias do Sumo Pontífice"", que ele próprio aprovou em abril de 2024 e foi publicada em novembro. 
A primeira parte do funeral é a Missa de sufrágio, que tem como objetivo interceder pela alma dos mortos. Esta missa foi celebrada na Basílica de São João de Latrão, em Roma, pelo cardeal Baldo Reina na tarde desta segunda-feira.
O corpo de Bergoglio passou por ritos de constatação da morte e deposição no caixão. O primeiro deles é a confirmação da morte, realizada pelo camerlengo - que é o cardeal responsável por administrar a Igreja durante o período de Sé Vacante. 
O camerlengo confirma a morte chamando o papa pelo nome três vezes. Após a confirmação, o ""Anel do Pescador"" é retirado e destruído, e o quarto do papa é selado. 
O corpo é colocado em um caixão de madeira revestido de zinco e levado para a Basílica de São Pedro, onde será velado na manhã desta quarta-feira (23). 
Na Basílica, o corpo será exposto diretamente no caixão, que será mais simples, feito de madeira revestida por zinco, ao invés dos três caixões tradicionais de cipreste, chumbo e carvalho.
4. Quando será o sepultamento?

De acordo com as regras da Igreja Católica, o enterro do papa deve ocorrer entre quatro e seis dias após sua morte. 
Diferente de outros pontífices, Francisco pediu para ser sepultado na Basílica de Santa Maria Maggiore, em Roma, ao invés da tradicional Basílica de São Pedro. A última vez que um Papa foi enterrado fora da Basílica de São Pedro foi em 1903, com o papa Leão XIII.
Além disso, missas serão celebradas por nove dias consecutivos, seguindo a tradição dos ""novendiales"". Este é um período de luto e oração dedicado à alma do papa, durante o qual a Igreja e os fiéis rezam pela sua passagem para a vida eterna.

5. Como Jorge  Bergoglio se tornou papa?
Bergoglio, que liderou a Igreja Católica por 12 anos, era conhecido por seu carisma e pelas reformas que implementou. Antes de se tornar papa, ele teve uma carreira diversificada: estudou química e trabalhou como professor.
Nascido em 17 de dezembro de 1936, em Buenos Aires, Francisco fez história ao ser o primeiro papa latino-americano. Ele também foi o primeiro pontífice da era moderna a assumir o papado após a renúncia de seu antecessor e o primeiro jesuíta a ocupar o cargo.
Francisco foi o 266º papa. Em 13 de março de 2013, durante o segundo dia do conclave para eleger o sucessor de Bento XVI,  Bergoglio foi escolhido como o novo líder da Igreja – mesmo contra sua própria vontade, como ele próprio admitiu.
Apesar de sua formação em Ciências Químicas e de ter sido professor de Literatura, Bergoglio, filho de imigrantes italianos, decidiu seguir a carreira religiosa e se dedicou aos estudos eclesiásticos.
Seu perfil jovial e descontraído fez dele uma escolha popular entre os cardeais e uma opção ideal para a Igreja, que enfrentava um período de grandes desafios.
6. Conclave: como é a escolha do novo papa? 
A escolha do novo líder da Igreja Católica começa entre 15 e 20 dias após a morte do papa. Durante esse período, o Vaticano convoca o Colégio dos Cardeais, que reúne religiosos de todo o mundo. Atualmente, esse grupo é composto por 252 cardeais, incluindo oito brasileiros.
Desses cardeais, 135 têm menos de 80 anos e estão aptos a participar da eleição do novo papa, sendo sete deles brasileiros. Antes do início da votação, chamada de Conclave, o Colégio dos Cardeais participa de reuniões chamadas ""Congregações Gerais"", onde discutem e votam questões governamentais da Igreja.
É através da Conclave que a Igreja Católica elege o novo papa. Durante os dias de eleição, os cardeais ficam isolados dentro do Vaticano, em uma área conhecida como ""zona de Conclave"", e fazem um juramento de segredo absoluto sobre o processo. Eles são proibidos de usar qualquer meio de comunicação com o exterior.
As votações ocorrem na famosa Capela Sistina. Para ser eleito, um cardeal precisa receber dois terços dos votos, que são secretos e queimados após a contagem. Até quatro votações podem ser realizadas diariamente.
Se após três dias não houver um novo papa, uma pausa de 24 horas é feita para orações. Outra pausa pode ocorrer após mais sete votações sem um eleito. Se houver 34 votações sem consenso, os dois cardeais mais votados disputam um ""segundo turno"", ainda precisando de dois terços dos votos para ser eleito. Quando um cardeal é eleito, ele escolhe um nome e veste as vestes papais na ""Sala das Lágrimas"".

7. Quem comanda a Igreja Católica agora?
Após a morte do Papa, a administração do Vaticano é confiada ao camerlengo, que é responsável pelos bens e pelo Tesouro do Vaticano. 
Atualmente, esse cargo é ocupado pelo cardeal irlandês naturalizado norte-americano Kevin Joseph Farrell. O camerlengo tem a função de organizar a transição durante a Sé Vacante, o período em que a Igreja Católica fica sem um pontífice. Ele também foi responsável por confirmar a morte do papa e assume temporariamente o Palácio Apostólico, a residência oficial do papa.
Enquanto o camerlengo mantém a autoridade administrativa, o Colégio dos Cardeais discute assuntos comuns ou urgentes da Igreja. No entanto, o Colégio dos Cardeais não pode fazer mudanças profundas na estrutura da Igreja, como alterar ou corrigir leis estabelecidas pelos papas.
Quando o papa morre, quase todos os religiosos da cúpula do Vaticano deixam suas funções, incluindo o Cardeal Secretário de Estado e os responsáveis pelos Dicastérios da Cúria Romana. Permanecem em seus cargos: o camerlengo, o Penitenciário-Mor, o Cardeal Vigário-Geral para a Diocese de Roma, o Cardeal Arcipreste da Basílica do Vaticano, o Vigário-Geral para a Cidade do Vaticano e o Esmoleiro Apostólico. 
8. Quando será anunciado o novo papa? 
A duração do conclave pode variar bastante. Por exemplo, o conclave que elegeu o papa Francisco em 2013 durou apenas dois dias, enquanto o mais longo da história, realizado entre 1268 e 1271, durou 34 meses.
Por isso, ainda não é possível saber exatamente quando a Igreja Católica anunciará seu novo líder. No entanto, é tradicional que o novo papa seja apresentado à multidão que aguarda na Praça de São Pedro, no Vaticano.
O pontífice é apresentado diretamente da sacada da Basílica de São Pedro, onde é proclamada a famosa frase ""Habemus Papam"", que significa ""Temos um papa"".

9. Quais os requisitos para ser papa? 
Oficialmente, não há requisitos básicos para que uma pessoa seja eleita papa – basta que ela seja católica e tenha pleno uso da razão. No entanto, na prática, há muitos séculos o eleito sempre tem sido do Colégio de Cardeais, o grupo que emite os votos no conclave. Este grupo é restrito a cardeais com menos de 80 anos.
Os cardeais são bispos e arcebispos nomeados pelo papa para auxiliar em questões religiosas. 
O conclave, que é o processo de eleição do novo papa, deve começar entre 15 e 20 dias após a morte do Papa. Desta vez, 135 cardeais estão aptos a participar da eleição, sendo sete deles brasileiros
10. Quem são os candidatos ao papado? 
O número de cardeais com direito de voto está acima do limite estabelecido por Paulo VI, que era de 120. A maioria desses eleitores foi nomeada cardeal pelo papa Francisco, mas nem todos compartilham sua filosofia ou política.
Um exemplo notável é o cardeal alemão Gerhard Ludwig Müller, um dos maiores críticos de Francisco, quase um inimigo. Outro exemplo é o cardeal Robert Sarah, da República da Guiné, na África Ocidental.
Entre os principais candidatos ao papado está o brasileiro Sérgio da Rocha, arcebispo metropolitano da Bahia. Desde 2023, ele faz parte do grupo dos nove cardeais conselheiros escolhidos pelo papa. 
Sérgio da Rocha é um grande apoiador das reformas de Francisco e está comprometido com o combate à homofobia e a inclusão de casais gays na Igreja.
Outros fortes candidatos incluem:
Jean-Marc Aveline, arcebispo de Marselha, francês, 66 anos;
Cardeal Peter Erdo, húngaro, 72 anos;
Cardeal Mario Grech, secretário-geral do Sínodo dos Bispos, maltês, 68 anos;
Cardeal Juan Jose Omella, arcebispo de Barcelona, espanhol, 79 anos;
Cardeal Pietro Parolin, italiano, diplomata do Vaticano, 70 anos;
Cardeal Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle, filipino;
Cardeal Joseph Tobin, arcebispo de Newark, NJ, americano, 72 anos;
Cardeal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson, ganês, funcionário do Vaticano, 76 anos;

Veja o calendário de feriados de 2025
A combinação da Sexta-feira Santa, no dia 18 de abril, e Tiradentes, nesta segunda-feira (21), garantiu a muitos trabalhadores um feriadão prolongado de quatro dias.
Agora, restam apenas sete feriados no ano, sendo que três deles podem ser emendados para prolongar os dias de descanso.
Esses feriados caem em quintas-feiras, permitindo emendar com a sexta e o fim de semana, dependendo da decisão de cada empresa. 
São eles:
1º de maio (Dia do Trabalhador);
20 de novembro (Dia da Consciência Negra);
25 de dezembro (Natal).
Além disso, o ano ainda terá outros quatro feriados que caem em finais de semana: 
7 de setembro (Independência do Brasil);
12 de outubro (Nossa Senhora Aparecida);
2 de novembro (Finados);
15 de novembro (Proclamação da República).
Os municípios e estados também podem determinar feriados locais, como Corpus Christi, que é considerado ponto facultativo.

Com a morte do papa Francisco nesta segunda-feira (21), cardeais de todo o mundo devem se dirigir ao Vaticano nos próximos dias para tomar parte no Conclave, votação secreta que escolhe o novo líder da Igreja Católica.
Ao todo, há 252 cardeais em todo o mundo, mas aqueles com mais de 80 anos não têm permissão para votar, pelas regras da igreja.
Devido à limitação de idade, apenas 135 estão aptos a participar do Conclave como eleitores — dos quais 120 deverão ser selecionados pelo cardeal camerlengo para participar do processo de escolha.
A Itália é de longe país com maior número de cardeais eleitores, com 17 deles, representando 12,6% do total.
O país é seguido pelos Estados Unidos (10) e pelo Brasil (7), que ocupa a terceira posição entre as nações com maior número de cardeais eleitores.

Entre os oito cardeais brasileiros, sete estão aptos a votar pelo critério de idade. 
São eles:
Sérgio da Rocha, Primaz do Brasil e arcebispo de Salvador, 65 anos.
Jaime Spengler, presidente da CNBB e arcebispo de Porto Alegre, 64 anos.
Odilo Scherer, arcebispo de São Paulo, 75 anos.
Orani Tempesta, arcebispo do Rio de Janeiro, 74 anos.
Paulo Cezar Costa, arcebispo de Brasília, 57 anos.
João Braz de Aviz, arcebispo emérito de Brasília, 77 anos.
Leonardo Ulrich Steiner, arcebispo de Manaus, 74 anos.
O único cardeal brasileiro que não poderá participar do Conclave é Raymundo Damasceno, arcebispo emérito de Aparecida, de 87 anos. 
Ainda assim, ele será convidado a integrar o Colégio dos Cardeais, que discutirá assuntos importantes da Igreja até a escolha do novo papa.
Europa e Ásia lideram no Conclave
Por continentes, a Europa tem o maior número de cardeais eleitores, somando 53 deles, com Itália, Espanha (5) e França (5) liderando entre os países com maior número de eleitores.
Em seguida, está a Ásia, com 23 eleitores, com maior contribuição da Índia (4) e Filipinas (3).
África (18), América do Sul (17) e América do Norte (16) vêm a seguir, com número similar de cardeais votantes, com a América Central e Oceania somando apenas quatro eleitores cada.
Entre os países com maior disparidade entre o número total de cardeais e aqueles aptos a votar estão Espanha (com 5 eleitores e 8 não-eleitores), Itália (com 17 para 34, respectivamente), Alemanha (3 para 3) e México (2 para 4).
A disparidade revela a importância histórica desses países na Igreja Católica, mas também o envelhecimento de suas lideranças – já que os cardeais com mais de 80 anos não podem votar.
Ao todo, 71 países poderão estar representados no conclave que deve eleger o sucessor do Papa Francisco. 
Desse total, 54 países contam com apenas um cardeal votante.
Católicos no mundo
Com 182 milhões de católicos em 2023, Brasil representa 13% do total mundial e continua sendo o país com a maior concentração de católicos do mundo

A Igreja Católica estima que haviam 1,4 bilhão de católicos no mundo em 2023, um crescimento de 1,15% em relação ao ano anterior.
A América lidera com a maior parcela dos católicos do mundo, somando 47,8%.
Desses, 27,4% vivem na América do Sul – onde o Brasil, com 182 milhões, representa 13% do total mundial e continua sendo o país com a maior concentração de católicos. ]
Outros 6,6% estão na América do Norte e os 13,8% restantes na América Central.
Comparando o número de católicos com a população total, Argentina, Colômbia e Paraguai se destacam, com católicos representando mais de 90% da população desses países, segundo as estimativas do Vaticano.
A África soma 20% dos católicos do mundo, com o número crescendo 3,3% entre 2022 e 2023, para 281 milhões.
Na Ásia, os católicos representam 11% do total global, com 77% dos católicos do sudeste asiáticos concentrados nas Filipinas (93 milhões) e na Índia (23 milhões).
A Europa, embora ainda seja o lar de 20,4% dos católicos do mundo, é a região de menor crescimento da religião do mundo, com variação de 0,2% entre 2022 e 2023. 
Em países como Itália, Polônia e Espanha, o catolicismo ainda é a religião de mais de 90% da população.
Apesar da relativa estabilidade no número de católicos no mundo, com destaque para o crescimento na África e Ásia, o número de padres têm diminuído.
Ao fim de 2023, era pouco menos de 407 mil, uma redução de 734 em relação a 2022, com crescimento na África (2,7%) e na Ásia (1,6%) e uma diminuição na Europa (-1,6%), Oceania (-1%) e nas Américas (-0,7%).",https://g1.globo.com/noticia/2025/04/22/qual-pais-tem-mais-cardeais-na-eleicao-do-novo-papa-veja-posicao-do-brasil.ghtml,pt

A viagem ao Brasil feita por Papa Francisco 
Segunda-feira, 22 de julho de 2013. Esse foi o dia em que o papa Francisco desembarcou no Rio de Janeiro trazendo afeto e humildade que marcaram sua visita.
O Santo Padre escolheu um carro econômico e foi do Aeroporto do Galeão à Catedral Metropolitana com janelas abertas. No meio do caminho, uma falha na segurança aproximou o Papa do povo. O carro ficou preso em um engarrafamento e a comitiva permaneceu bloqueada por uma onda de amor e carinho.
Antes de participar da Jornada Mundial da Juventude, no Rio de Janeiro, o Papa foi de helicóptero até a cidade de Aparecida, em São Paulo. Na Basílica, o maior templo católico do Brasil, celebrou sua primeira missa pública na América Latina, que foi acompanhada por mais de 12 mil fiéis.
No mesmo dia, ele voltou para o Rio de Janeiro ao Hospital São Francisco de Assis da Providência de Deus, onde inaugurou uma ala para o tratamento de dependentes químicos.
Mais de 500 mil fiéis vieram de várias partes do Brasil para ver Francisco. Naqueles seis dias de julho de 2013, Francisco deixou mensagens carregadas de esperança.
Francisco quebrou o protocolo para se aproximar da multidão.
O Papa argentino retribuiu tudo pacientemente e com o bom humor que sempre foi sua marca registrada.
Em 12 anos de pontificado, Francisco não voltou para sua cidade natal, mas no Rio ele teve um encontro especial com seus conterrâneos. Cerca de 30 mil argentinos foram até a Catedral Metropolitana e muitos se apertaram do lado de fora para vê-lo.
No Teatro Municipal, ele ouviu o discurso emocionado de um morador do Complexo da Maré. O encontro mudou a vida de Valmir.
Alguns dos encontros mais esperados da Jornada estavam previstos para acontecer em Guaratiba, na Zona Oeste, mas as fortes chuvas transformaram a estrutura do Campus Fidei em um grande lamaçal. Os eventos foram transferidos para as areias de Copacabana, na Zona Sul.
A Jornada reuniu mais de 3 milhões de fiéis e peregrinos diante de um altar montado na areia, superando assim o público que todos os anos participa do Réveillon.
No primeiro grande encontro com os fiéis, Francisco desceu do helicóptero no Forte de Copacabana e seguiu de papamóvel até o altar. Sua Santidade mais uma vez interagiu com as pessoas que estavam no caminho.
Francisco surpreendeu ao trocar presentes com um fiel no meio da rua. Ele não pensou duas vezes e entregou o solidéu - a peça usada pelo Santo Padre para cobrir a cabeça.
""A todos e a cada um, um abraço afetuoso. Bem-vindos à 28ª JMJ nesta cidade maravilhosa do Rio de Janeiro"", disse.
Jornada Mundial da Juventude, no Rio de Janeiro, que reuniu mais de 3 milhões de pessoas.
Jornal Nacional
Durante a celebração da Missa de Acolhida, Francisco usou o tempo fechado para falar da fé. ""Sempre ouvi dizer que os cariocas não gostam de frio e chuva, mas vocês estão mostrando que a fé de vocês é maior que o frio e a chuva. Parabéns, vocês são verdadeiros guerreiros. Vejo em vocês a beleza do rosto jovem de Cristo e meu coração se enche de alegria"", disse.
As gêmeas, Yasmim e Sophia, tinham apenas 16 dias de vida quando foram abençoadas por Francisco.
Um dos momentos de maior emoção aconteceu na visita à favela de Varginha, na Zona Norte do Rio. A comunidade se enfeitou para receber o Papa. Ele visitou a casa de uma família. Dona Glória Araújo lembra que fez de tudo para que ele pudesse abençoar a neta.
Ele também abençoou o altar da igreja da comunidade e ganhou das crianças uma faixa do seu time do coração: o San Lorenzo.
No dia seguinte, Francisco voltou a Copacabana e acompanhou ali a encenação da Via Sacra. Aproveitou para fazer um discurso contra a intolerância, o racismo e o sofrimento de vítimas da violência e da fome, e pediu coragem aos jovens para mudar o mundo.
Francisco usou a imagem do Cristo Redentor para dizer que não podemos ficar de braços cruzados e que é preciso abrir os braços.
Em uma entrevista exclusiva ao jornalista Gerson Camarotti, falou sobre brasileiros e argentinos.
“Eu me senti recebido com um afeto que desconhecia, de forma muito calorosa. O povo brasileiro tem um grande coração. Quanto à rivalidade, creio que já está totalmente superada, porque negociamos bem: o Papa é argentino e Deus é brasileiro”, disse.
Na Missa de Encerramento, o Papa disse que transmitir a fé com alegria permite receber em troca mais alegria.
No Rio, Francisco deixou uma forte mensagem de esperança e um sorriso que ficará para sempre guardado no coração dos brasileiros.

Circula pelas redes sociais uma imagem que imita a aparência de uma reportagem do g1 com o título: ""Lula decreta feriado pela morte de Papa Francisco"". É #FAKE. 

g1
O g1 não publicou uma página com o esse título. A imagem é uma montagem fraudulenta. A página distorce um conteúdo verdadeiro publicado pelo g1: o anúncio de que Lula decretou luto oficial de sete dias pela morte do Papa Francisco —não um feriado.
""É declarado luto oficial em todo o País, pelo período de sete dias, contado da data de publicação deste Decreto, em sinal de pesar pelo falecimento de Jorge Mario Bergoglio, Sua Santidade o Papa Francisco, a quem serão tributadas honras fúnebres de Chefe de Estado"", diz o decreto.
Questionada pelo Fato ou Fake, a Secretaria de Comunicação da Presidência da República aponta que  o decreto 12.440, publicado em edição extra do Diário Oficial da União nesta segunda-feira, declara luto oficial pelo falecimento do Papa Francisco, mas não institui feriado ou ponto facultativo algum. 

Jorge Mario Bergoglio, o papa Francisco, morreu aos 88 anos às 2h35 pelo horário de Brasília, 7h35 pelo horário local, desta segunda-feira (21). Segundo o Vaticano, a morte foi causada por um acidente vascular cerebral (AVC) e insuficiência cardíaca.
O pontífice, que ocupou o cargo máximo da Igreja Católica por 12 anos, se recuperava de uma pneumonia nos dois pulmões após ter ficado 38 dias internado. Ele morreu em seu apartamento, na residência de Santa Marta, na Cidade do Vaticano, onde vivia desde sua eleição em 2013.

O resgate ocorreu nesse domingo (20) depois que os familiares acionaram o Corpo de Bombeiros do município. A criança foi encontrada assustada, mas sem ferimentos. 
A avó do menino ligou avisando que o menino, que não fala, havia entrado na floresta e se perdido. Ao chegar no local, os bombeiros iniciaram as buscas logo pelos locais onde havia água, principalmente um igarapé. 
Após alguns minutos de buscas, um bombeiro viu um vulto correndo e se aproximou para verificar o que era. 
 A criança estava assustada e andando sem direção, até que o bombeiro se aproximou devagar para não assustá-la mais ainda. O menino foi entregue aos familiares.

Francisco viajou para mais de 65 países em 12 anos de pontificado
Milhões de fiéis do mundo todo tiveram a oportunidade de ver e ouvir o Papa Francisco em pessoa, sem precisarem ir ao Vaticano.
A escolha dos destinos nunca foi despretensiosa. Viagens papais são uma ferramenta poderosa de diplomacia e fortalecimento do alcance da Igreja Católica.
O Papa Francisco gostava de mandar recados e chamar a atenção do mundo para crises e conflitos. E, por onde passou, atraiu multidões.
Francisco foi a mais de 65 países de cinco continentes em 12 anos. Foram 47 viagens internacionais.
A primeira vez foi para o Rio de Janeiro, para a Jornada Mundial da Juventude. Francisco mostrou por que ficou conhecido como o Papa da simplicidade.
A ida à Terra Santa, no segundo ano, revelou o talento diplomático que marcaria seu pontificado. Francisco visitou locais sagrados para muçulmanos, cristãos e judeus, e pediu que todas as religiões buscassem a paz. Começava aí o legado de defensor da tolerância religiosa.
Francisco foi a mais de 75 países de cinco continentes em 12 anos
Jornal Nacional
Ao lado do primeiro-ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, e do então presidente Shimon Peres, Francisco pediu que a solução de dois estados - um israelense e um palestino - não permanecesse um sonho.
E chamou Shimon Peres e o presidente da Autoridade Palestina, Mahmoud Abbas, para visitarem juntos o Vaticano.
O encontro histórico foi no mês seguinte, ao lado do Patriarca de Constantinopla, Bartolomeu I, que lidera parte dos cristãos ortodoxos.
No Sri Lanka, o líder da Igreja Católica participou de um grande encontro com budistas, muçulmanos e hindus.
E nas Filipinas, Francisco bateu um recorde histórico de público num evento papal. Foram mais de seis milhões de pessoas.
Francisco foi um dos articuladores da retomada das relações diplomáticas entre os Estados Unidos e Cuba, congeladas desde a década de 1970. Depois da conquista, ele visitou os dois países, em 2015.
Em Cuba, se reuniu com os irmãos Fidel e Raul Castro.
Saindo de Cuba, o Papa foi para os Estados Unidos e esteve no memorial para as vítimas dos atentados terroristas de 11 de setembro de 2001. Discursou também na sede da ONU, em Manhattan. Já na capital Washington, fez história mais uma vez.
Depois de visitar o presidente Barack Obama, se tornou o primeiro Papa a falar no Congresso americano. Entre os temas, defendeu o respeito aos imigrantes. Uma multidão acompanhou em telões, e ele foi aplaudido de pé.
A primeira visita à África veio no terceiro ano de pontificado, com o objetivo de mostrar ao mundo a pobreza e as necessidades do povo africano. Francisco passou pelo Quênia e por Uganda.
E nem a guerra civil entre milícias cristãs e muçulmanas o impediu de ir à República Centro-Africana. Nunca antes um Papa tinha ido a uma zona de guerra na era moderna.
Francisco também se tornou o primeiro líder da Igreja Católica a se reunir com o Patriarca da Igreja Ortodoxa Russa desde a separação dos dois ramos do cristianismo, quase mil anos antes.
Na ilha grega de Lesbos, o Papa ofereceu asilo a três famílias de refugiados que voltaram no avião com ele para o Vaticano.
A caminhada em silêncio absoluto pelo campo de concentração de Auschwitz está entre os momentos marcantes. É o local de extermínio de mais de um milhão de judeus durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial.
E na passagem por Mianmar e Bangladesh, o Papa defendeu a minoria muçulmana rohingya, perseguida por nacionalistas budistas.
Polêmicas marcaram algumas viagens. No Chile, em 2018, manifestantes foram às ruas contra a impunidade de padres pedófilos.
O Papa pediu perdão pelos crimes que abalaram a Igreja do Chile. Falou que sentia dor e vergonha pelo dano irreparável causado a crianças.
No Peru, se reuniu com povos da Amazônia e fez uma defesa enfática do meio ambiente e dos direitos dos indígenas. Foi a sexta viagem à América Latina.
Mas Francisco nunca voltou à terra natal, Argentina, depois de eleito.
Nos Emirados Árabes Unidos, se tornou o primeiro chefe da Igreja Católica a pisar na Península Arábica, o berço da religião islâmica. Primeira vez também no Iraque.
Francisco conheceu a cidade de Ur, venerada como o local de nascimento de Abraão: pai do judaísmo, do cristianismo e do islamismo.
Na cidade sagrada de Najaf, se encontrou com a maior autoridade islâmica xiita do Iraque: o aiatolá Al-Sistani. A imagem dos dois líderes religiosos condenando o extremismo rodou o mundo.
O que marcou a viagem ao Canadá foi o pedido de desculpas pelos abusos da Igreja contra os indígenas.
No ano seguinte, o Papa voltou a zonas de conflito: na República Democrática do Congo e no Sudão do Sul.
A preocupação com a saúde marcou a viagem mais longa do pontificado, em setembro do ano passado.
Em uma jornada histórica, Francisco percorreu quatro países de dois continentes em 12 dias: Indonésia, Papua-Nova Guiné, Timor-Leste e Singapura.
A visita de um Papa à ilha de Córsega, na França, em dezembro, também foi inédita. A última da lista longa de heranças simbólicas de um Papa que sabia o poder de sua presença.

De acordo com a PM, o homem marcou um encontro com o adolescente no sábado (20), no Centro da capital. O jovem foi atraído com a promessa de dinheiro e levado para a casa do suspeito, no bairro Tancredo Neves, Zona Leste da cidade, onde os abusos ocorreram.
Após perceber o desaparecimento, a família da vítima procurou a polícia. O suspeito foi localizado na manhã de domingo, na Avenida Rodrigo Otávio, Zona Sul, quando levava o adolescente de volta para casa.
Durante a abordagem, os policiais encontraram no carro alimentos, ovos de Páscoa e doces infantis. A suspeita é de que o material seria usado para atrair outros menores de idade.
Segundo a polícia, o suspeito já tem passagem por estupro. Ele foi encaminhado à Delegacia Especializada em Proteção à Criança e ao Adolescente (Depca), onde passou pelos procedimentos legais.
O adolescente prestou depoimento, foi submetido a exame de corpo de delito e recebeu atendimento médico preventivo, pois há suspeita de que o homem seja portador de uma infecção sexualmente transmissível.

O cardeal João Braz de Aviz tem 77 anos, nasceu em Santa Catarina e é o mais velho entre eles. Foi nomeado cardeal durante o papado de Bento XVI e era muito próximo do Papa Francisco. Hoje, vive em Roma.
Dom Orani Tempesta tem 74 anos, nasceu no interior de São Paulo. Já foi arcebispo de Belém, no Pará. Foi transferido em 2014 para o Rio de Janeiro, onde está até hoje. 
""Nós sabemos aquilo que ele deixa como legado: a sua preocupação com os pobres, com a paz no mundo, com a fraternidade, com a ecologia, com o meio ambiente.""
Dom Leonardo Steiner tem 74 anos, nasceu em Santa Catarina, já foi duas vezes secretário-geral da Confederação Nacional dos Bispos do Brasil (CNBB). Foi nomeado arcebispo de Manaus em 2019 pelo Papa Francisco. 
""Tinha um carinho tão grande pela Amazônia, pelo pulmão da terra, mas especialmente pelos seus povos, e especialmente pelos povos originários.""
O presidente da CNBB e atual arcebispo de Porto Alegre, Dom Jaime Spengler, tem sessenta e quatro anos. É de Gaspar, Santa Catarina. 
""Ele mesmo com aquela dificuldade que a gente via para se expressar e conversar, ele queria saber de tudo e de todos. Eu diria um homem com uma vontade de ferro.""
Dom Paulo Cezar Costa é o cardeal brasileiro mais novo que deve participar do conclave. Tem 57 anos, nasceu em Valença, no Rio de Janeiro, e foi transferido para a Arquidiocese de Brasília, onde é o atual arcebispo. Hoje, Dom Paulo Cezar lembrou que o papa Francisco foi um incansável defensor da paz. 
""Falou como ninguém contra as guerras, contra a violência, mostrando que o caminho não é a guerra, o caminho não é a violência, o caminho é o diálogo. O Papa ligava quase todos os dias para o pároco ali da Faixa de Gaza para falar com ele, para ver como é que estava a comunidade cristã, como é que estava a realidade ali.""

Outro cardeal brasileiro que participa do conclave já foi cotado para ser Papa. É o arcebispo de São Paulo, Dom Odilo Scherer, desde 2007 à frente da maior arquidiocese da América do Sul. Dom Odilo trabalhou na Cúria Romana e é um nome influente da Igreja Católica. Ele nasceu no Rio Grande do Sul e foi nomeado cardeal pelo Papa Bento XVI. 
Quando completou 75 anos, em 2024, enviou uma carta ao papa Francisco para comunicar a renúncia ao cargo de arcebispo metropolitano. O pedido faz parte de uma norma da Igreja Católica para bispos que chegam nessa idade. O Papa acolheu a solicitação, mas pediu que Dom Odilo permaneça mais dois anos no comando da arquidiocese. 
Dom Odilo falou sobre a diversidade de países no próximo conclave: ""Terá a presença de cardeais do mundo todo, bem mais do que os conclaves anteriores. Do seu pensamento de integrar na igreja e na representação do que o Colégio Cardinalício representa, toda a igreja, e não apenas as áreas que sempre tiveram mais exposição, mais presentes. Mas também as áreas missionárias, as áreas onde a igreja precisa ainda mais se propor e também precisa se afirmar.

Veja favoritos a suceder o papa Francisco
Se o Papa Francisco será sucedido por alguém a quem ele deu a púrpura de cardeal, é apenas uma possibilidade.
Atualmente, o número de cardeais com direito de voto, ou seja, com menos de 80 anos de idade, está acima do limite estabelecido por Paulo VI, que era de 120 purpurados. O que vai exigir um quórum mais alto para a eleição do novo Papa.
O Papa Francisco não criou um colégio só de gente que pensa como ele. Ao contrário, deu espaço para todas as tendências: progressista, conservadora, reformista e tradicionalista. Uma das reformas deste Papa foi mudar a geopolítica do colégio de cardeais. Por isso, esse conclave é considerado um dos mais indecifráveis de que se tem notícia.
Há quem afirme que, pouco antes de ir para o hospital, o próprio Papa Francisco estivesse já trabalhando pelo seu sucessor.
Um dos preferidos de Francisco pode representar uma surpresa no conclave: o cardeal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, patriarca latino de Jerusalém.
Franciscano, é natural de Bérgamo. Dos seus quase 60 anos de idade, viveu mais de 30 na Terra Santa. Seria um Papa italiano, mas com um conhecimento único do Oriente Médio. É apreciado por israelenses e palestinos.
O secretário de Estado do Vaticano, teoricamente, é sempre um papabile. Embora não tenha tantos casos na história dos pontificados. Pietro Parolin, veneziano, moderado, diplomata com grande capacidade de mediação, é reconhecido como de centro. A favor dele, além das suas qualidades, joga o peso do jubileu, quando o trono papal não pode ficar vazio por muito tempo. Parolin seria uma escolha de Cúria, rápida, para conquistar um consenso.
Se a preferência for um Papa de linha pastoral e progressista, há outros nomes fortes como Matteo Zuppi, arcebispo de Bolonha e presidente da Conferência Episcopal Italiana. Também diplomata. Poderia se tornar o Francisco II. Zuppi agrada tanto às comunidades gays como às organizações religiosas em defesa da família.
O brasileiro Sérgio da Rocha, arcebispo metropolitano da Bahia, também é citado em algumas listas. Desde 2023, ele está no grupo dos nove cardeais conselheiros, escolhidos pelo Papa. É um grande apoiador das mudanças de Francisco e comprometido com o combate à homofobia e com a inclusão de casais gays na Igreja.
Se o colégio cardinalício quiser prosseguir no caminho das inovações e reformas, com uma visão mais aberta do mundo, é um forte candidato.
Conclave, para escolher sucessor de Papa Franscisco, é considerado um dos mais indecifráveis de que se tem notícia
Jornal Nacional
Um cardeal conservador, e muito respeitado pelo Papa Francisco, o arcebispo de Budapeste, Péter Erdő, torna-se um nome forte. Viveu o comunismo e foi vítima de perseguição religiosa. Foi presidente da Conferência Episcopal Húngara e relator de vários sínodos. 
Em questões políticas como a imigração, contra a qual a Hungria vem lutando há alguns anos, Erdő transmitiu uma abordagem equilibrada, reconhecendo o direito de imigrar e a necessidade de integrar refugiados sem colocar em risco a estabilidade política.
Entre os conservadores, um nome que vem crescendo, dentro e fora do clero africano: o cardeal congolês Fridolin Ambongo Besungu. Ambongo liderou a oposição ao documento da Igreja que autorizou a bênção aos casais homossexuais.
Da Ásia, o filipino Luis Antonio Tagle, teólogo ilustre, aparece sempre em todas as listas há vários anos. Apreciado por Francisco e pelos conservadores da Cúria Romana. Figura discreta, neto de avô materno chinês. Um detalhe não sem importância, seria um bom nome para a Igreja mais universal criada por Francisco.
Outros nomes cotados para Papa: o austríaco Christoph Schönborn, considerado um teólogo brilhante, próximo de Bento XVI, mas também um dos apoiadores do Papa Francisco. Defende o acolhimento aos divorciados que se casaram novamente e aos homossexuais. Rigoroso contra os casos de abuso sexual.
Jean-Marc Aveline, arcebispo de Marselha, cidade multiétnica e multirreligiosa. Seria o primeiro Papa francês desde a época do Papado de Avignon, mais de seis séculos depois. Francisco tinha uma forte ligação com Marselha pela boa convivência entre as religiões.
Há muitas apostas de que o papado voltará para as mãos de um italiano.
Fala-se também de um cardeal espanhol, de Malta, da Holanda. Também do Canadá e um afro-americano.
Mas, para os favoritos, existe sempre aquela máxima vaticana repetida em cada conclave: quem entra papabile sai cardeal.

O prefeito Leonardo Vasconcellos decretou, nesta segunda-feira (21), luto oficial de três dias na cidade de Teresópolis, na Região Serrana do Rio, em homenagem ao papa Francisco, que morreu aos 88 anos na madrugada desta segunda, após ficar 12 anos à frente da Igreja Católica.
Em nota postada nas redes sociais, a prefeitura lamentou a morte e destacou a humildade, a empatia e o legado deixado pelo pontífice.
""Lamentamos profundamente o falecimento do Papa Francisco, um líder de incomensurável importância, cuja voz era marcada pelo respeito, humildade e acolhimento ao próximo, além de ser uma referência global em matéria de fé.

AO VIVO: Acompanhe a repercussão da morte do papa
A morte de um papa dá início a uma série de ritos e cerimônias cuidadosamente organizadas muito antes do início do Conclave para eleger o sucessor. Elas envolvem a certificação da morte e a exibição pública do corpo para que os fiéis possam prestar homenagens, além do funeral e do sepultamento.
O papa Francisco revisou diversos ritos no ano passado, simplificando os rituais funerários para enfatizar seu papel como um simples bispo. Mas os elementos centrais permanecem, incluindo três momentos-chave que devem ser observados entre a morte de um papa e seu sepultamento: preparação, exposição e sepultamento do corpo.

Assim que a morte de Francisco foi anunciada, fiéis começaram a chegar à Praça São Pedro, o mesmo local em que o Papa esteve ontem para as celebrações do Domingo de Páscoa.
O sino do Vaticano anunciou a morte do Papa. A Praça São Pedro, enfeitada para a Páscoa, agora exibe as bandeiras a meio mastro, em luto.
Aos poucos, o vai e vem de turistas e peregrinos foi dando lugar a homenagens e reflexões.

O padre Gerard veio da Irlanda e acompanhou, ontem, as celebrações do Domingo de Páscoa, com a participação do Papa. ""Foi um prazer vê-lo, mas houve um suspiro coletivo quando ouvimos a voz dele... Estava tão fraca que todos nós pensamos que, talvez, aquela seria a sua última aparição pública.""
A emoção transborda para fora dos muros vaticanos.
Karen é do Reino Unido e esteve na Basílica Santa Maria Maior, a preferida de Francisco e onde ele pediu para ser enterrado. 
""Me sinto muito abençoada de ter visto o Papa ontem, tão perto do fim... Por isso vim aqui hoje - para me sentir próxima mais uma vez, agora que ele se foi.""
""Eu moro aqui perto e sempre via o Papa, ele deve ter vindo aqui mais de cem vezes. Eu o amava muito"", contou Maria.
Homenagens também em frente da Casa Santa Marta, onde o Papa morava e onde ele faleceu.
William contou que conheceu Francisco pessoalmente há dois anos. 
""Foi um momento muito poderoso. Vim aqui hoje para ficar perto dele uma última vez e me despedir. A chama de sua existência viverá sempre entre nós.""
O sol ainda brilhava quando começou a primeira cerimônia oficial de hoje do Vaticano aberta ao público. O cardeal Mauro Gambetti liderou um rosário em homenagem a Francisco. Ele lembrou a tradicional frase de Francisco: ""Rezem por mim"". ""Hoje, disse o cardeal, queremos orar por ele.""
E foi com terço nas mãos, lágrimas nos olhos e muita emoção que milhares de católicos rezaram por Francisco na Praça São Pedro – e milhões ao redor do mundo.
Ao fim do rosário, aplausos.
À noite, as orações continuaram, com um outro rosário na Basílica Santa Maria Maior.
Mesmo depois das 23h da noite em Roma, a Praça São Pedro continua. Um casal chileno encontrou um cantinho para a oração.

Essa menina no Quênia resumiu: ""Ele foi um Papa muito bom. Vou sentir falta dele para sempre.""
A morte também repercutiu nas Filipinas, Coreia do Sul, Kosovo, Hungria e Jerusalém. Na Igreja do Santo Sepulcro, um dos locais mais sagrados do Cristianismo, um padre celebrou Francisco como ""um homem da paz"".

Líderes de países em conflito se manifestaram. O russo Vladimir Putin descreveu o Papa como “um homem fora do comum”. O ucraniano Volodymyr Zelensky afirmou que o Papa Francisco ""sabia dar esperança, aliviar o sofrimento e promover a união”. “Ele rezou pela paz na Ucrânia e pelos ucranianos”, lembrou Zelensky. Hoje, foram os ucranianos que rezaram pelo Papa.
O presidente de Israel, Isaac Herzog, disse ter esperança de que as orações de Francisco pela paz no Oriente Médio se concretizem. O presidente da Autoridade Palestina, Mahmoud Abbas, se referiu ao Papa como um ""fiel amigo do povo palestino"" e lembrou que Francisco ""reconheceu o Estado da Palestina"".
Em Roma, com bandeiras a meio mastro, a primeira-ministra italiana Giorgia Meloni disse que está profundamente triste, lembrou dos muitos conselhos que recebeu do pontífice e disse que Francisco foi um grande homem e pastor. 
Da Alemanha, o primeiro-ministro Olaf Scholz elogiou a clareza do Papa ao abordar os desafios contemporâneos e disse que a igreja e o mundo perderam um defensor dos fracos.
O presidente americano Donald Trump escreveu: ""Descanse em paz, Papa Francisco. Deus o abençoe e a todos os que o amavam."" Depois, na Casa Branca, disse que Francisco foi um homem bom, que ele amava o mundo. O vice-presidente americano JD Vance, católico, expressou solidariedade aos cristãos e lembrou o encontro que teve ontem com o Papa. Francisco estava nitidamente muito fraco.
A presidente do México definiu o Papa como um humanista que sempre esteve perto dos pobres. Claudia Sheinbaum falou em perda dolorosa. Na Ásia, o primeiro-ministro indiano, Narendra Modi, descreveu Francisco como um “farol de compaixão, humildade e coragem espiritual”. 
O secretário-geral da ONU, António Guterres, celebrou o Papa como uma voz transcendente pela justiça social.
A dedicação do Papa Francisco aos pobres, aos refugiados - aos marginalizados, em geral - foi o ponto em comum da grande repercussão internacional ao longo do dia. Aqui em Londres, muitos fiéis vieram prestar homenagens na Catedral de Westminster, da Igreja Católica. Mas a comoção foi em todo o Reino Unido. A Igreja Anglicana, o primeiro-ministro e o Rei Charles III lamentaram profundamente a morte do Papa.
Num comunicado do Palácio de Buckingham, Charles afirmou que ele e a Rainha Camilla estão com ""o coração pesado"". O rei lembrou a visita a Francisco no início do mês. O comunicado fala em “perda devastadora de um fiel seguidor de Jesus Cristo”.
O cardeal britânico Timothy Radcliffe lembrou uma frase que o Papa costumava dizer e que ajuda a explicar a tristeza do mundo hoje: ""O Papa dizia todos são bem-vindos, todos, todos,... porque ele acreditava que a Igreja é uma casa universal, em que todos devem se sentir acolhidos.""",https://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2025/04/21/morte-do-papa-francisco-repercute-no-mundo.ghtml,pt

Francisco deixa um legado reformista depois de 12 anos de pontificado
Jorge Bergoglio teve doze anos de pontificado. Foi um período importantíssimo para a Igreja Católica pelos movimentos que o Papa argentino fez em direção a reformas. Francisco fez uma opção clara pelo ato de acolher, em vez de julgar.
Naquele dia 13 de março de 2013, a escolha do primeiro Papa latino-americano causou um grande impacto. O argentino Jorge Mario Bergoglio derrotou, no conclave, candidatos italianos que pareciam favoritos, porque a Igreja precisava mudar. Tinha que deixar para trás os escândalos de corrupção, de carreirismo e de vazamento de informações, como o Vatileaks.
O cardeal que vinha da longínqua periferia de Buenos Aires, pegava transporte público e voava em classe econômica, imediatamente respondeu ao chamado. 
Papa Francisco foi um dos mais populares da atualidade

Ao ouvir do amigo brasileiro, o cardeal Cláudio Hummes dizer ""não se esqueça dos pobres"", Bergoglio anunciou o seu nome de pontífice: ""Francisco"". Uma homenagem a São Francisco de Assis, o santo que abandonou uma vida de luxo para se dedicar aos pobres.
Iniciou assim o seu pontificado: combatendo alguns símbolos ostensivos de riqueza. O ouro da cruz, que ele passou a usar de latão. O anel de pescador, ele preferiu de metal prateado. O sumo pontífice rejeitou o imenso apartamento papal do Palácio Apostólico e foi morar na Casa Santa Marta, num quarto sóbrio e modesto.
A sua revolução simbólica não demorou a ganhar concretude. O primeiro ato foi moralizar o Banco do Vaticano, fechando mais de duas mil contas. Depois de muitas tentativas, Francisco conseguiu dar transparência , com novas leis contra crimes financeiros. Mas substituir um Papa vivo não foi uma tarefa simples para o primeiro pontífice jesuíta da história.
Na herança do antecessor, muitos documentos secretos. Francisco recebeu das mãos de Bento 16 caixas de papéis e pistas do que estava errado dentro dos muros.

Viagens do Papa
Para a sua primeira viagem como Papa, ele escolheu Lampedusa. Na ilha siciliana chegavam milhares de imigrantes da Líbia, depois da travessia mortal no Mediterrâneo. Os refugiados se tornaram um dos temas mais sensíveis para Francisco. E ali ele falou pela primeira vez em globalização da indiferença.
O Brasil foi o primeiro país destinado ao Papa argentino. Quatro meses depois da posse, ele saiu andando numa avenida carioca, assustando a segurança e inaugurando um estilo muito diferente para um líder da Igreja. Em Copacabana, rezou com três milhões na missa da Jornada Mundial da Juventude.
No voo de volta a Roma, ouvimos as palavras que determinariam um novo rumo ao pontificado. Quando perguntei sobre os gays dentro do Vaticano, Francisco respondeu: ""Quem sou eu para julgar?"". 
Por esta frase, até então inédita para um Papa, ele ganharia a simpatia de tantos e a oposição feroz dos mais conservadores.

Mudanças na Igreja
Dez anos depois, Francisco aprovaria uma nova orientação: a bênção aos casais do mesmo sexo na Igreja. Outro motivo de ruptura com os tradicionalistas. A sua primeira exortação apostólica, Evangelii Gaudium, propunha uma nova evangelização e questionava o modelo da economia capitalista.
Vítima de forças econômicas internacionais, que não perdoaram o seu discurso social demais, Francisco começou a ser combatido também pelos conservadores em defesa da doutrina. 
A cada sínodo convocado por ele, os seus inimigos começaram a crescer, resistindo às experiências de inovação do Papa, como a comunhão aos divorciados que se casaram de novo.
A conduta do Papa Francisco contra a pedofilia – nem sempre bem-sucedida – foi muito severa. E hoje as penas para os religiosos que cometem este crime são maiores. Cardeais e bispos não possuem mais os privilégios de antes. E o segredo pontifício foi abolido para casos de abuso sexual. O Papa encontrou vítimas e pediu perdão. Mas as organizações de vítimas esperavam mais.
Denúncias de corrupção na administração da economia vaticana também atingiram colaboradores de Francisco, que foram afastados e condenados.
Na política internacional, Francisco mediou crises mundiais importantes, como entre Cuba e os Estados Unidos de Barack Obama. Influenciou o acordo de paz entre o governo colombiano e as principais guerrilhas do país. As relações da Santa Sé com a China foram recuperadas em 2018. 
Na corajosa viagem ao Iraque, ele pregou a irmandade, contra o fundamentalismo. ""A hostilidade, o extremismo e a violência não nascem de uma alma religiosa.""
O Papa de Roma criou relações de amizade profundas com autoridades muçulmanas e hebraicas. ""As nossas diferenças não são um dano, um perigo, são uma riqueza."" 
Deu passos importantes na unidade dos cristãos. Num dos seus grandes eventos, quatro papas estiveram presentes. Dois em espírito, na canonização de João Paulo II e João XXIII. Bento XVI ficou ao lado de Francisco.
Nos últimos anos do seu pontificado, conseguiu finalmente investir na reforma da Cúria – o governo da Igreja Católica. 
Francisco dedicou mensagens de ternura, quase que diariamente, aos pobres e marginalizados. E isso, num pontificado, tem um peso.
Os seus dramas pessoais foram vividos com discrição. A sua história argentina durante a ditadura, a sua ausência do país de origem. 
Francisco era também um homem brincalhão, capaz de provocações como a pergunta que sempre fazia aos brasileiros: ""Quem é melhor: Pelé ou Maradona?  
O Papa Francisco nunca teve medo de dizer o que pensava. Ele foi capaz de se tornar um interlocutor da sociedade moderna. Mas no seu íntimo, era mais missionário do que progressista. Por isso, de certa forma, desiludiu os que esperavam para a mulher um papel mais decisivo na Igreja. 
Nas entrevistas que dava, havia sempre algo revelador da sua intimidade. E ele não teve pudor em confessar a sua psicoterapia. 
""Durante os dias terríveis da ditadura argentina, quando tinha que levar pessoas na clandestinidade para sair do país, vivi situações nas quais não sabia o que fazer. Então fui encontrar uma senhora, uma psiquiatra, por seis meses, uma vez por semana. Estou convencido de que cada sacerdote deve conhecer a psicologia humana.""
Sobre a sua morte, chegou a descrever como a imaginava. ""Como Papa ou emérito. E em Roma. Não voltarei à Argentina."" Deixou uma carta de renúncia, caso a sua saúde o tivesse impedido de governar a Igreja Católica.
Elas não se tornaram sacerdotes no seu pontificado. Mas Francisco foi o primeiro Papa a admitir: ""Um dos grandes pecados que cometemos foi masculinizar a Igreja. E uma tarefa que vos peço, por favor, é desmasculinizá-la.""
Em 6 de janeiro deste ano, nomeou a primeira prefeita do Vaticano, irmã Simona Brambilla. No dia 20, escolheu outra religiosa como a primeira governadora da cidade-estado, Raffaella Petrini.
Problemas de saúde
O declínio físico, nos últimos quatro anos, não o desestimulou a continuar no comando. Na hospitalização em julho de 2021, Francisco teve um pedaço do intestino retirado por uma diverticulite. A sua presença agitou o Agostino Gemelli, conhecido como o hospital dos papas. 
Mesmo convalescente, mostrou aquela qualidade de não conseguir ficar parado. Andou pelos corredores, visitou crianças com câncer e rezou o Angelus da janela do décimo andar.
""Aqui estão algumas crianças amigas doentes. Por que as crianças sofrem? 'Por que as crianças sofrem' é uma questão que toca o coração. Acompanhem-nas com a oração e rezem por todos os enfermos.""
Os efeitos da anestesia demoraram meses a passar. Por isso, em 2022, quando a dor crônica nos joelhos se tornou muito aguda, o Papa preferiu uma cadeira de rodas à cirurgia.
Trabalho pela paz
A sua campanha diplomática contra a guerra na Ucrânia comoveu os católicos, mas não os líderes das nações em guerra. Às ofertas de Francisco para mediar as negociações entre Vladimir Putin e Volodymyr Zelensky, no solo neutro do Vaticano, a resposta foi o silêncio. 
Incansável, o Papa continuou os seus apelos pela paz, dia após dia. Principalmente depois que explodiu a guerra entre Israel e o Hamas, após os ataques terroristas de 7 de outubro de 2023, que mataram 1,2 mil pessoas e fizeram 250 reféns.
Em vários momentos, cresceu a tensão entre o chefe da Igreja Católica e o primeiro-ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. O Papa Francisco, além de lamentar a morte dos israelenses, denunciou inúmeras vezes a matança de milhares de crianças palestinas pelas armas de Israel.
""Oremos pelas vítimas, em especial, pelas crianças.""
Francisco deixou legado
Nas liturgias, o pontífice argentino também deixou o seu rastro. Criou novas regras para as missas em latim, retomadas pelo antecessor. E as missas modernas, dos anos de 1970, pós-Concílio Vaticano II, não poderão mais ser esquecidas.
Em 2020, como líder espiritual, em plena pandemia de covid, Francisco obteve ainda mais consenso popular. As suas orações comoveram o mundo assustado e carente de afeto. A sua imagem solitária, na Praça São Pedro deserta, andando com dificuldade, provavelmente ficará para sempre na história dos pontificados.",https://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2025/04/21/papa-francisco-teve-12-anos-de-pontificado-e-fez-movimentos-em-direcao-a-reformas-da-igreja.ghtml,pt

Os últimos momentos do Papa no modesto apartamento da Casa Santa Marta foram reconstruídos por fontes vaticanas. Ele acordou às seis da manhã, e os colaboradores o encontraram bem, embora seu estado geral já estivesse seriamente comprometido há dias, inclusive o coração.
Pouco depois, por volta das 7 horas, duas da manhã no horário de Brasília, o Papa se sentiu mal. Foi imediatamente assistido pela equipe médica presente no Vaticano. Às sete e trinta e cinco, Francisco parou de respirar.
A causa da morte foi um derrame cerebral seguido de parada cardíaca. Os médicos comentaram que ele morreu serenamente.
Às nove e quarenta e sete, o camerlengo, o camareiro da Igreja, Cardeal Kevin Farrell, deu a notícia:
""Queridos irmãos e irmãs, é com profunda tristeza que devo anunciar o falecimento do nosso Santo Padre Francisco. Às 7h35 desta manhã, o Bispo de Roma, Francisco, retornou à casa do Pai. Toda a sua vida foi dedicada ao serviço do Senhor e da sua Igreja. Ele nos ensinou a viver os valores do Evangelho com fidelidade, coragem e amor universal, especialmente em favor dos mais pobres e marginalizados. Com imensa gratidão por seu exemplo como verdadeiro discípulo do Senhor Jesus, encomendamos a alma do Papa Francisco ao infinito amor misericordioso do Deus Uno e Trino.""

A morte pegou de surpresa o Vaticano, apesar da fragilidade da saúde dele nos últimos meses. No dia quatorze de fevereiro, ele foi hospitalizado com uma bronquite. A crise respiratória se tornou uma pneumonia, e Francisco precisou de equipamentos para ajudar na respiração. Foram quarenta dias no Hospital Gemelli. Quando recebeu alta, os médicos disseram que levaria muito tempo para que ele estivesse totalmente recuperado.
Mas o Papa não desistia de estar próximo dos fiéis e participou como pôde das celebrações de Páscoa.
Funeral de Francisco
O corpo de Francisco foi levado para a Capela Santa Marta e seguirá para a Basílica de São Pedro, na quarta-feira (23).
Francisco mudou as regras dos funerais papais e o corpo dele deverá ser enterrado fora dos muros vaticanos. Ele escolheu a Basílica de Santa Maria Maggiore, em Roma.
A data do funeral será anunciada nesta terça-feira (22).

Mais de 100 filhotes de tartaruga marinha foram soltos, no fim de semana, em Salvaterra, na ilha do Marajó.
Os quelônios da espécie tartaruga verde fazem parte da primeira ninhada de 2025, no berçário da Praia Grande, a principal do município.
As tartaruguinhas foram soltas na água com ajuda de moradores voluntários.
O berçário já existe há dois anos e segundo os biólogos do Projeto Bicho d'Água', que atuam na região, o aproveitamento dos ovos chocados no local é de 80%.
A conscientização dos moradores sobre a preservação da espécie vem garantindo o sucesso do projeto, que conta com apoio da Secretaria Municipal de Meio Ambiente de Salvaterra.
Os técnicos da secretaria fazem o monitoramento das ninhadas.
Novos filhotes de tartaruga devem nascer no início do mês de junho.

O bom humor era uma das marcas registradas do papa Francisco e o padre Francisco Jaber Zanardo Moussa pode comprovar cara a cara a jovialidade do pontífice ao entregar a ele uma garrafa de cachaça.

""Ele fez a brincadeira que faz com todo brasileiro, que a cachaça do Brasil é sempre muito boa, e aí eu completei com a música que nós conhecemos, que vem do alambique e a água vem do Ribeirão. E aí ele sorriu e acolheu com muito carinho essa fala"".

O encontro aconteceu no Vaticano, em 2024, e nesta segunda-feira (21), após a confirmação da morte do papa Francisco, aos 88 anos, padre Chico relembrou o momento com emoção.
""Foi um momento de muita emoção, muita alegria, o papa Francisco sempre muito acolhedor, receptivo. O papa é muito espirituoso, é muito gestual, é uma pessoa que testemunha o evangelho, deixou pra gente esse exemplo de vida"".
Além da cachaça, Francisco recebeu outros presentes de padres da região de Ribeirão Preto ao longo dos 12 anos em que esteve à frente da Igreja Católica. Em uma das ocasiões, o bispo Paulo Roberto Beloto, da Arquidiocese de Franca (SP), entregou em mãos um par de sapatos produzido na cidade.

Em 2013, no primeiro ano de papado, Francisco esteve no Brasil durante a Jornada Mundial da Juventude e o padre Anderson Xavier Lopes, da Paróquia de Nossa Senhora dos Canaviais, integrava a equipe que levou jovens de Ribeirão Preto ao encontro, no Rio de Janeiro.
""Antes de voltar para o Vaticano, ele teve um encontro somente com o voluntários da JMJ e também tive a oportunidade de estar com ele. Depois, em 2016, participei na Polônia com ele, como peregrino"".
Dom Ilson de Jesus Montanari, de Sertãozinho (SP), segundo na hierarquia dos camerlengos no Vaticano, deve participar dos preparativos para o funeral do pontífice e para a escolha de um novo líder da Igreja Católica.
Primeiro papa latino-americano
Jorge Mario Bergoglio, o papa Francisco, morreu em casa, aos 88 anos, nesta segunda-feira (21). O pontífice ficou conhecido pelo perfil carismático e pelas reformas que promoveu na Igreja Católica.
Ao longo da carreira, antes de ser papa, o argentino também estudou química e trabalhou como professor. Nascido em 17 de dezembro de 1936, em Buenos Aires, Francisco foi o primeiro papa latino-americano da história.
Ele também foi o primeiro pontífice da era moderna a assumir o papado após a renúncia de seu antecessor e, ainda, o primeiro jesuíta no posto.
Francisco foi o papa número 266. Em 13 de março de 2013, durante o segundo dia do conclave para eleger o substituto de Bento XVI, Bergoglio foi escolhido como o novo líder – inclusive contra sua própria vontade, segundo ele mesmo admitiu.
Mas a carreira no catolicismo foi uma escolha própria do argentino. Formado em Ciências Químicas e professor de Literatura, o religioso, filho de imigrantes italianos, acabou se dedicando aos estudos eclesiásticos.
O perfil jovial e descontraído do religioso fez com que ele se tornasse uma opção popular entre os colegas cardeais e uma escolha ideal para a Igreja, que vivia um de seus momentos mais delicados.

Morador de Nova Friburgo relembra participação na JMJ de 2013
A notícia da morte do papa Francisco na madrugada desta segunda-feira (21) reacendeu memórias de um encontro emocionante que mudou a vida de John Mascouto, morador de Nova Friburgo, na Região Serrana do Rio. Ele teve participação ativa na Jornada Mundial da Juventude (JMJ) Rio 2013, quando tinha 28 anos, e conseguiu não só ver o papa, mas tocá-lo.
Na ocasião, o pontífice, recém-eleito, estava na primeira viagem apostólica e fazia um dos trajetos dentro de um carro. O toque no papa ocorreu durante a vigília em Copacabana, que reuniu 3,7 milhões de pessoas. Foi um momento rápido, mas com significado profundo para John (veja no vídeo acima).
“Era tanta gente querendo tocar o Santo Padre... e eu consegui! Foi um momento de grande emoção, no meio de jovens do mundo inteiro, todos falando línguas diferentes. Foi ali que caiu a ficha: estávamos diante de um verdadeiro sucessor de Pedro"", lembrou.

De um página no Facebook à organização da JMJ
Tudo começou em 2010, quando o então Papa Bento XVI anunciou que a próxima edição da JMJ seria realizada no Brasil. Entusiasmado, John criou uma página não oficial no Facebook dedicada ao evento. O projeto viralizou, reunindo milhares de seguidores, tornando-se um dos principais canais de divulgação da Jornada entre jovens católicos brasileiros e estrangeiros.
O engajamento digital abriu portas para que ele se envolvesse diretamente na organização da JMJ, vivenciando de perto os preparativos até a chegada do Papa Francisco, que assumiu o pontificado após a renúncia de Bento XVI, em 2013.
Uma conexão cultural e espiritual
A eleição do papa Francisco, o primeiro pontífice latino-americano da história, fortaleceu o sentimento de proximidade. 
“O fato de ele ser argentino fazia a gente se sentir ainda mais conectado”, relembra John.
Essa conexão ganhou forma na pré-Jornada, quando a Paróquia Santa Teresinha, em Conselheiro Paulino, em Nova Friburgo, acolheu 60 peregrinos argentinos.
“Eles chegaram e a gente foi organizando: esse vai para a casa do fulano, aquele para a casa do cicrano... Era uma troca cultural riquíssima”, diz John.
O legado de Francisco: uma igreja ""para todos"" 
A experiência com o Papa argentino transformou a percepção de John sobre o papel da Igreja e de seu líder máximo.
“O ensinamento que mais carrego é o que ele repetia: ‘A Igreja é para todos. Todos, todos, todos.’ Ele abriu as portas, tirou a igreja das sacristias e colocou-a no meio do povo”, afirma.
Com voz embargada, John lembra que, mesmo em seus últimos momentos, o Papa Francisco deixou uma última bênção de Páscoa para os fiéis.
“Ele celebrou a última Páscoa com a gente e fez sua passagem. Foi a sua própria Páscoa"".
Luto e esperança pelo futuro
Sobre o momento atual da Igreja após a morte do pontífice, John, hoje com 40 anos, acredita que é tempo de recolhimento e oração. 
“Agora a Igreja vive o luto. Depois vem o conclave, a escolha do novo Papa. Mas a gente confia: Deus já sabe quem será o próximo sucessor"".
Com a voz firme, ele finaliza:
“Dez anos depois daquele encontro, o que fica é a certeza de que o Papa Francisco mudou a Igreja — e mudou a gente. Foi um Papa de sorriso largo, de fala simples, de acolhida verdadeira. E isso ninguém vai esquecer"".

Para celebrar a trajetória e o legado do Papa Francisco, diversas igrejas da capital maranhense estão promovendo celebrações. A primeira missa foi realizada no Santuário de São José de Ribamar nesta segunda-feira (21), às 15h. Durante a cerimônia, os fiéis rezaram pela alma do papa.
Ainda na noite desta segunda-feira (21), às 18h, a Igreja da Sé, localizada no Centro Histórico da cidade, também realizou uma missa em homenagem ao Papa Francisco, reunindo fiéis da região e vários padres de diferentes paróquias da capital maranhense. Na Catedral Metropolitana de São Luís, foi lembrada a história do pontífice que comandou a Igreja Católica por doze anos.
O arcebispo de São Luís, Dom Gilberto, conversou com a equipe da TV Mirante e destacou a importância da figura do Papa Francisco. 
“Ele era um papa que acolhia os excluídos e fez com que a igreja se identificasse e fosse para o mundo. Ele não escolheu ninguém; ele amava todos. Ele condenava o pecado, mas amava o pecador e abria as portas para a possibilidade da conversão. Isso é muito bonito. Isso é fidelidade a Jesus, que ama e nos perdoa”, disse o arcebispo.
Além da Catedral da Sé, missas também foram realizadas nas paróquias Mãe Divina Providência, Perpétuo Socorro e Boa Viagem, assim como nas paróquias Divino Espírito Santo e Santíssima Trindade.
Nesta terça-feira (22), será celebrada outra missa na Nossa Senhora Aparecida da Foz do Rio Anil, no Cohafuma, às 7h da manhã e na Paróquia São Maximiliano, no Vinhais, às 19h. Já no próximo domingo (27), no Santuário de Nazaré, as missas de sétimo dia ocorrerão às 6h30, 9h, 17h e 19h.

Morte do papa
Papa Francisco morre aos 88 anos
Vaticano
Papa Francisco morreu às 7h35, no horário de Roma (2h35 no horário de Brasília). Segundo a certidão médica de atestado, o pontífice sofreu um AVC, entrou em coma e teve um colapso cardiocirculatório irreversível. O quadro foi agravado por pneumonia bilateral, bronquiectasias múltiplas, hipertensão e diabetes tipo 2, conforme o boletim médico.
Francisco foi eleito como papa em 2013. Nascido em 17 de dezembro de 1936, em Buenos Aires, na Argentina, ele foi o primeiro papa latino-americano da história.
Ele será enterrado na Basílica de Santa Maria Maggiore, em Roma, e não na Basílica de São Pedro, no Vaticano. A última vez que isso aconteceu foi em 1903, com o enterro do papa Leão XIII. As cerimônias fúnebres de Francisco seguirão uma série de ritos e começaram já nesta segunda-feira, segundo o Vaticano.
Na manhã de quarta-feira (23), o corpo do papa será levado para a Basílica de São Pedro, em Roma, para que fiéis possam prestar a última homenagem ao papa.
O religioso foi internado no dia 14 de fevereiro, no Hospital Policlínico Agostino Gemelli, em Roma, Ele deixou o hospital no dia 23 de março, ainda utilizando oxigênio, e fez algumas aparições públicas.

Assaltantes roubaram dois carros e duas vans da Prefeitura de Buritizeiro após um deles pedir água para o guarda municipal que fazia a segurança do local na madrugada do domingo (20). A ocorrência foi finalizada nesta segunda-feira (21) com a prisão de três homens e todos os veículos recuperados.  
O guarda municipal contou para a Polícia Militar que, ao abrir a porta para entregar um copo ao homem que pediu a água, foi surpreendido pelos comparsas dele, que estavam armados, de boné e com os rostos cobertos com um tipo de plástico.  
Sob ameaças de morte, a funcionário foi obrigado a dizer onde estavam as chaves dos veículos estacionados na garagem. Em seguida, ele teve os braços e pernas amarrados e permaneceu dentro de um banheiro.  
Ao notar que os criminosos haviam fugido, o guarda conseguiu se soltar e pediu ajuda de colegas, que estavam na base da instituição e acionaram a PM. Além dos carros e vans, os bandidos fugiram levando eletrodomésticos.  
A perícia da Polícia Civil esteve no local e recolheu uma bolsa contendo roupas, sandálias e outros pertences dos autores.  
Durante os levantamentos, os policiais do 55° Batalhão da PM acionaram o proprietário da locadora onde um dos carros foi alugado. Por meio de rastreamento, foi descoberto que o automóvel estava em Vespasiano, Região Metropolitana de Belo Horizonte. Uma equipe do 36°  Batalhão da PM fez a apreensão do veículo.

Durante a abordagem, foram presos três homens, de 20, 24 e 34 anos. Um deles estava com as chaves das vans. Os detidos foram levados para a delegacia da Polícia Civil da cidade. 
Ainda conforme a PM, as vans foram apreendidas por militares do 42º BPM com apoio do 7° BPM na zona rural de Pompéu.  
Os quatro veículos recuperados foram levados para pátios credenciados ao Detran.

Um grupo de moradores de Fernando de Noronha realizou um protesto, nesta segunda-feira (21), para reivindicar eleição para escolha do administrador da ilha (veja vídeo acima). 
Um projeto de emenda constitucional (PEC) tramita na Assembleia Legislativa de Pernambuco (Alepe) e prevê que a população possa escolher em votação direta o gestor local.
A eleição foi discutida pelo Conselho Distrital e o projeto foi apresentado na Alepe pelo deputado estadual Waldemar Borges (PSB).

O ato pela eleição direta teve a concentração em frente à Escola Arquipélago, no bairro da Floresta Velha. Os moradores seguiram em passeata pelas ruas e rodovia rodovia BR-363 e seguiram até a Vila dos Remédios.

Opinião dos conselheiros e moradores
O conselheiro distrital Ailton Araújo Júnior foi um dos organizadores do protesto. “É um sonho nosso, nunca tivemos opção de escolher o gestor da ilha. A pessoa eleita será de Noronha e irá usar os serviços, como hospital, posto de saúde, área social, e a situação mudará”, disse Ailton Júnior. 
O conselheiro Daniel Oliveira também participou do ato que reivindicou eleição direta. “Nós queremos a democracia plena. Em qualquer lugar do mundo os representantes são eleitos pelo voto. É uma dificuldade tremenda não ter o direito de escolher quem vai comandar a ilha”, falou.
Já o arquiteto e morador da ilha João Rocha afirmou que a população quer ter o direito ao voto. “Nós temos amadurecimento político, não é possível seguir sem direito ao voto, precisamos ter a opção de escolher e até errar, se for o caso, e votar novamente e tentar acertar”.
A empresária Natália Veríssimo da Costa disse que o objetivo do movimento é reforçar a necessidade de mudança no sistema de gestão. “Nos lutamos por democracia, Noronha é o único do Brasil que não elege o gestor. Vivemos como o regime monárquico. Isso precisa acabar, estamos em 2025 e isso precisa mudar”..
Eleições
Os moradores de Fernando de Noronha votam a cada quatro anos e elegem os conselheiros distritais, governador, senador, deputados e presidente da República. 
O cargo de administrador geral é indicado pelo governador (a), mas, antes da posse, o candidato precisa ser sabatinado pela Comissão de Justiça da Alepe e aprovado em plenário pelos em deputados estaduais. 
A ilha está sem administrador geral desde a exoneração da ex-gestora, no final de janeiro. Confira o que aconteceu desde lá:
No dia 28 de janeiro a então administradora da ilha, Thallyta Figueirôa, foi exonerada e a governadora anunciou o nome do biólogo Walber Santana como substituto.
No dia 19 de fevereiro, a indicação de Walber Santana chegou à Comissão de Justiça da Alepe. 
No dia 10 de março, véspera da sabatina, a governadora Raquel Lyra (PSD) desistiu da indicação de Walber Santana.
No dia 27 de março, o governo do estado publicou no Diário Oficial as exonerações e nomeações de 29 profissionais em cargos de gestão da Administração de Fernando de Noronha. Segundo informações apuradas pelo g1, os atos eram relativos à nova equipe do governo local e à saída de gestores que estavam em atividade.
No dia 28 de março, foi encaminhada à Alepe a indicação do advogado Virgílio de Almeida Ignácio de Oliveira como nome para administrador de Fernando de Noronha. 
No dia 8 de abril, o administrador adjunto de Fernando de Noronha, José Aglailson Queralvares Neto, teve a nomeação publicada no Diário Oficial do Estado. 
Enquanto a situação não se resolve, Fernando de Noronha segue sem administrador geral. O administrador ajunto, José Aglainson Neto, ocupa a função de forma interina.

No dia do acidente, a PRF foi chamada, isolou a área e acionou a perícia e o Instituto Médico Legal (IML). 
À Rede Amazônica Acre, a equipe policial que estava na ocorrência informou que retirou o motorista do local com medo de represálias, mas que ele seria apresentado na Delegacia de Flagrantes (Defla) para depoimento e demais procedimentos.

Ainda no local do acidente, a PRF disse que pegou os dados do motorista e o depoimento, porém, por conta da comoção e do baixo efetivo, 'permitiu que Talysson deixasse o local'. Com isso, o motorista não foi apresentado na delegacia no dia do acidente, sendo liberado.
Após o acidente, a PRF alegou que o motorista suspeito de atingi-lo e outros dois motociclistas foi liberado por possível risco à sua integridade por conta da revolta no local.
Conforme a PRF, o motorista fez o teste do bafômetro, que deu negativo, apresentou a documentação necessária e foi liberado pela polícia por medo de represálias de conhecidos das vítimas. A corporação contestou ainda a alegação de que o suspeito foi protegido por supostamente ser integrante de forças de segurança.

Um peixinho roubou a cena e o coração de um pescador no rio Jamari, em Candeias do Jamari (RO). Ao invés de nadar de volta para a água, como era de se esperar, o bichinho parecia decidido a acompanhar o pescador, como se quisesse ser levado junto para casa. A cena inusitada foi registrada em vídeo e logo viralizou nas redes sociais (veja acima).
Ao g1, João Cordeiro, o pescador que protagonizou o encontro inusitado, contou que a atitude do peixinho foi tão fora do comum que ele chegou a cogitar levá-lo para casa.
""Geralmente os peixes correm, mas esse aí ficou parado olhando. Já sou pescador há uns anos, mas esse tipo de reação de um peixe comigo foi a primeira vez, me deu vontade de criar ele num aquário"", disse João, ainda surpreso.
O vídeo do momento foi parar nas redes sociais e, além de impressionar, arrancou boas risadas. Na legenda, João resumiu bem a situação: ""Daquelas histórias que se contar ninguém acredita"". Internautas entraram na brincadeira e comentaram que a cena parecia até ter sido “combinada com o peixe”.

De acordo com o pescador, o pequeno peixe mede cerca de 10 centímetros. Mas o que realmente chamou atenção foi o comportamento carinhoso do bichinho.
""Esse peixe estava mais dócil que muitos gatinhos que encontro nas pescarias"", brincou João.

Um prédio em Santos, no litoral de São Paulo, teve a garagem do subsolo e o poço do elevador alagados devido às fortes chuvas. As imagens de câmeras de monitoramento, obtidas pelo g1 nesta segunda-feira (21), mostram os momentos de tensão vividos pelos moradores do edifício (veja acima).

O caso aconteceu durante o temporal que atingiu a Baixada Santista na noite de sábado (19). Segundo o Centro Nacional de Monitoramento e Alertas de Desastres Naturais (Cemaden) e o Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (Inmet), a cidade de Santos registrou 126 mm em um período de 24 horas. 
O prédio fica entre as ruas Pedro Ivo e Torres Homem, no bairro Embaré. Moradora do edifício desde 2004, a administradora de empresas Simone Prado, de 47 anos, contou que estava presente na primeira vez que a chuva invadiu o local. De acordo com ela, a situação ocorreu em março de 2020, quando mais de dez pessoas morreram durante um temporal na região.

Simone explicou que, por conta disso, o prédio providenciou comportas -- estruturas utilizadas para controlar o fluxo de líquidos, principalmente água. Inclusive, as imagens mostram dois homens instalando os equipamentos de aço para barrar a enchente, por volta das 19h55 de sábado. 
A força da água, causada por dois carros que passaram na rua alagada, derrubou a contenção e quebrou o portão, invadindo a garagem subsolo e o elevador do prédio. Às 20h20, o alagamento já estava na metade das rodas dos carros estacionados. 
""A gente ficou assustado, claro. Muita gente tem medo do fogo, mas a água também é muito rápida"", comentou Simone. ""A velocidade da água estava muito forte. Não tinha o que fazer, aí [começou] a correria para tirar os carros e colocá-los para a garagem de cima"", acrescentou. 
Força-tarefa 
No vídeo, ainda é possível ver a força-tarefa organizada pelos moradores para retirar os veículos de dentro da garagem. Segundo Simone, os residentes mais antigos, que passaram pelo alagamento de 2020, conseguiram montar a logística para que a situação fosse resolvida com segurança.

""Tinha gente operada, que não podia tirar o carro, aí o outro [morador] tirou. A gente fez uma força-tarefa dentro do que estava possível para gente salvar o máximo de carros. Graças a Deus ficou todo mundo bem e não tinha ninguém dentro do elevador"", afirmou a administradora. 
Ainda de acordo com Simone, o carro de um morador que estava viajando e algumas motos acabaram ficando dentro da garagem. Além disso, um outro veículo não conseguiu subir até a rua e ficou na rampa para proteger o motor.   
O g1 não localizou a administração do edifício até a última atualização desta reportagem.

Redes Sociais
A Defesa Civil informou que a cidade esteve entre os municípios que registraram maior acumulado do estado em um período de 24 horas. Vídeos mostram que diversos trechos de Santos ficaram alagados, incluindo a avenida da praia. 
Até quem estava abrigado no Praiamar Shopping, no bairro Aparecida, sofreu os impactos da chuva. Isso porque a água invadiu o local após uma infiltração na cúpula, que causou um vazamento.

A g1 apurou que quatro assaltantes encapuzados abordaram três banhistas e anunciaram o roubo. Dois criminosos estavam armados. Durante o assalto, os bandidos efetuaram disparos contra o trio.

Big tech foi derrotada em outro julgamento, na última sexta (18), desta vez sobre concorrência desleal na publicidade. Pessoas passam diante do logotipo do Google em uma feira em Hannover, na Alemanha
Annegret Hilse/Reuters
O Google começou a enfrentar um julgamento histórico nesta segunda-feira (21). O resultado poderá dar mais argumentos para que autoridades exijam o desmembramento da big tech.
O Departamento de Justiça dos Estados Unidos acusa a gigante da tecnologia de monopólio nas buscas online. E quer que o Google venda o navegador Chrome como parte de uma tentativa de restaurar a concorrência no mercado.
Na última sexta (18), em outra ação aberta pelo mesmo departamento, uma juíza federal concluiu que o Google tem o monopólio na publicidade online.
A decisão sobre o que deve ser feito ainda não saiu, mas o pedido das autoridades é que a empresa venda partes de sua plataforma de anúncios.
Como será o julgamento
O processo sobre o domínio do Google nas buscas foi aberto ainda em 2020, ainda no primeiro governo de Donald Trump. Os autores da ação são o Departamento de Justiça (DOJ) do governo federal e uma coalizão de 38 procuradores-gerais estaduais.
O julgamento deverá levar três semanas e será conduzido pelo juiz distrital Amit Mehta, em Washington.
Ele acontece no mesmo tribunal em que a Meta está enfrentando seu próprio julgamento antitruste sobre as compras do Instagram e do WhatsApp.
Entre as testemunhas de acusação estão representantes da OpenAI, dona do ChatGPT, e da Perplexity, que também é uma inteligência artificial que responde a buscas.
O que quer a acusação
No primeiro dia de julgamento, um advogado do Departamento de Justiça disse que serão necessárias medidas rigorosas para impedir que o Google use seus produtos de inteligência artificial para ampliar seu domínio na busca online.
As propostas do DOJ para o aumento da concorrência com o Google nas buscas incluem:
o fim dos acordos exclusivos nos quais a big tech paga bilhões de dólares anualmente à Apple e a outros fornecedores de dispositivos para tornar o Google o mecanismo de busca padrão em seus tablets e smartphones.
o licenciamento de resultados de pesquisa para os concorrentes.
a venda  do sistema operacional móvel Android, se outras medidas não conseguirem restaurar a concorrência.
O que diz o Google
A adoção dos remédios propostos pelo DOJ ""atrasaria a inovação norte-americana em um momento crítico"", disse a executiva do Google, Lee-Anne Mulholland, em um post no último domingo (20).
""Quando se trata de remédios antitruste, a Suprema Corte dos EUA disse que 'cautela é fundamental'. A proposta do DOJ joga essa cautela ao vento"", completou.
O Google argumenta que seus produtos de IA estão fora do escopo do caso, que se concentrou nos mecanismos de busca.

""Estive no Itamaraty e fiz alguns requerimentos. Amanhã irei fazer contato com o membro da Corte Interamericana de Direitos Humanos [...] Reunirei com os representantes do Itamaraty e das embaixadas brasileiras que ficam na Bolívia para que nós possamos acelerar e melhorar essa investigação"", disse Bordalo. 
O senador Randolfe Rodrigues (PT), apresentou um requerimento que foi aprovado no Congresso Nacional que institui uma Comissão Temporária Externa. Essa comissão deve investigar o caso de Jenife e apurar as condições enfrentadas por outros brasileiros que vivem na Bolívia. 
""Para tomar as medidas necessárias, primeiro para a repatriação do corpo de Jenife ao Brasil aos seus familiares, em segundo lugar para a culpabilização dos culpados. Mas parece que o caso de Jenife traz uma segunda situação, que é a situação de uma comunidade de mais de 6 mil brasileiros que estudam medicina em Santa Cruz de La Sierra"", disse Randolfe.

Em 2013, George Paulo da Silva estava com 31 anos e participava do grupo de jovens da Paróquia São Marcos. Ele e os demais jovens se juntaram para arrecadar o dinheiro para a viagem ao Rio de Janeiro, na Jornada Mundial da Juventude. 
Eles fizeram rifas, pastel e bingo e conseguiram o valor. Aproximadamente 20 jovens foram para a viagem.

Vista privilegiada e bênção
George contou que, além de dormirem na praia para não perderem lugar na passagem do papa pela região, ele precisou improvisar para ter uma vista privilegiada. 
""Ele estava vindo no papa móvel e na minha frente tinha muita gente, e eu não tinha uma visão privilegiada. E tinha uma estrutura. Não lembro se era uma árvore ou estrutura de ferro. E eu subi nessa estrutura com a câmera ligada para filmar. Na hora que o papa Francisco passou, eu tenho a nítida imagem que ele olhou para mim, deu a bênção e passou, e eu com a câmera na mão. Só que depois, no final, na hora que eu fui ver eu não tinha nem apertado o botão para gravar de tanta emoção"", relembra.
Ele classifica o momento como ""surreal"". ""É muita emoção. Você vê o amor passando na sua frente. E é aquele amor que contagia você"".
'A partir de agora é com vocês'
O catequista relembra o momento que mais lhe marcou nas mensagens transmitidas por Francisco durante a viagem.
""Eu acho que o que mais causou impacto [do que ele disse] foi de ser missionário. Ele falou: 'a partir de agora é com vocês. O papa esteve aqui, conversou com todos vocês e, a partir de agora, a continuidade de tudo isso vai partir de cada um de vocês, na paróquia de cada um de vocês, na comunidade de cada um de vocês'. Então, essa acredito que seja a grande mensagem. O papa está lá em Roma, mas aqui no São Marcos é nós que temos que fazer as coisas acontecerem"", interpreta.

Davi Izaque Martins Silva, de 29 anos, foi denunciado pelo Ministério Público (MP) em setembro de 2023, com base no indiciamento da Polícia Civil, por homicídio qualificado por motivo torpe, meio cruel, à traição e feminicídio. A denúncia ainda atribuiu ao acusado a tentativa de ocultação de cadáver, tipificação aceita pela Justiça. A determinação do júri popular foi publicada no Diário Oficial da Justiça em 16 de junho de 2024.

À época, o inquérito foi concluído pelo delegado responsável pelo caso, Alceu Lima de Oliveira, por meio da Divisão Especialização em Investigações Criminais (Deic).
As investigações apontaram que a médica Thallita Fernandes, de 28 anos, foi esfaqueada no início da manhã do dia 18 de agosto de 2023, logo depois que o acusado chegou ao apartamento. Davi está preso preventivamente no Centro de Detenção Provisória (CDP) de Rio Preto.
Segundo o boletim de ocorrência, foi a mãe de Thallita, que mora em Guaratinguetá (SP), quem notou o desaparecimento da filha e pediu para que uma amiga da vítima fosse até o prédio onde ela morava, no bairro Redentora, em Rio Preto.
Ainda de acordo com o BO, o apartamento de Thallita, localizado no 3º andar, estava trancado. Por isso, essa amiga acionou a polícia. O corpo da vítima foi encontrado nu, na lavanderia do apartamento, dentro de uma mala.

Pelas câmeras de segurança, a polícia pôde constatar que o namorado, com quem ela mantinha um relacionamento havia cerca de dois anos, foi o último a entrar e deixar o apartamento.
As imagens mostram o momento em que o acusado deixou o apartamento da vítima e caminhou pelo corredor do prédio em direção ao elevador. Vestindo um boné e camiseta vermelha, ele foi até o térreo, saiu do local usando o celular e entrou em um carro de aplicativo que o aguardava na rua (assista ao vídeo acima).

A polícia informou que Davi chegou a deixar a cidade, com destino a Olímpia (SP), mas voltou a Rio Preto, onde foi detido.
Ao delegado, o acusado confessou o crime e disse que usou drogas antes do assassinato. Davi também confirmou que brigou com Thallita no mesmo dia em que a matou.
Segundo o delegado, o intuito do acusado era ocultar o corpo da vítima, mas a mala rasgou. Davi não tinha passagens criminais e o comportamento dele não indicou arrependimento, ainda segundo a polícia, que acredita que ele era financeiramente dependente dela e não aceitava o fim do namoro.

O presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) e a primeira-dama Janja irão ao funeral do papa Francisco em Roma, informou o Palácio do Planalto nesta segunda-feira (21). 
A comitiva completa deve ser anunciada nesta terça-feira (22), de acordo com o governo. A viagem ainda não tem data confirmada, dependendo do protocolo do Vaticano, segundo a Secretaria de Comunicação Social da Presidência (Secom). 
Lula e Janja se encontraram com o papa Francisco por algumas vezes. Eles trataram da guerra da Rússica contra a Ucrânia,  o combate à fome e sobre as mudanças climáticas (leia mais aqui). Lula e Janja também realizaram uma missa pela saúde do papa no Palácio da Alvorada, residência oficial da Presidência.

Jorge Mario Bergoglio morreu aos 88 anos às 7h35 desta segunda no horário do Vaticano (2h35, no horário de Brasília). O pontífice ocupou o cargo máximo da Igreja Católica por 12 anos.
À frente da Igreja Católica por quase 12 anos, Francisco foi o papa número 266. Em 13 de março de 2013, durante o segundo dia do conclave para eleger o substituto de Bento XVI, Bergoglio foi escolhido como o novo líder – inclusive contra a sua própria vontade, segundo ele mesmo admitiu.
Lula também decretou luto oficial de sete dias no Brasil pela morte do papa Francisco na manhã desta segunda. Por volta das 10h, as bandeiras em frente ao Palácio do Planalto e ao Supremo Tribunal Federal já eram hasteadas a meio-mastro – símbolo do luto nos prédios públicos.
""É declarado luto oficial em todo o País, pelo período de sete dias, contado da data de publicação deste Decreto, em sinal de pesar pelo falecimento de Jorge Mario Bergoglio, Sua Santidade o Papa Francisco, a quem serão tributadas honras fúnebres de Chefe de Estado"", diz o decreto de luto publicado no ""Diário Oficial da União"".
""Francisco foi o papa do acolhimento e por isso acordamos hoje um pouco orfãos do seu afeto. Um afeto que era livre de preconceitos e julgamentos. Em um mundo que sofre com a discriminação e a insegurança. Para francisco, somos todos irmãos criados para amarmos uns aos outros. Por sermos todos irmãos, não há razão para tanta discórdia, tanto ódio, tantas guerras e tanta desigualdade no mundo. Francisco foi o papa de todos, mas principalmente dos excluídos, dos mais pobres, dos injustiçados, dos imigrantes, dos que não tem voz, das vítimas do abandono e da fome"", afirmou Lula em um vídeo divulgado pela Presidência da República na noite desta segunda.

""Papa Francisco foi o papa da paz, do diálogo, da união e do amor a todas as formas de vida. Fez seguidos alertas sobre a crise climática a ameaça de distribuição do nosso planeta – obra prima da criação divina. Condenou todas as guerras, que tem como vítimas preferenciais a população civil - sobretudo mulheres e crianças"", continuou Lula.
""Na sua bênção de despedida no domingo de páscoa, pediu para voltarmos a ter esperança de que a paz é possível. Francisco foi o papa da esperança. Em sua despedida, renovou a crença nos seres humanos e previu o futuro melhor para a humanidade. Disse que o amor venceu o ódio, a verdade venceu a mentira, o perdão venceu a vingança. Isso é o mundo que haveremos de construir inspirados no papa Francisco. Se formos capazes de cultivar a paz, o amor a justiça e a fraternidade. Que Deus abençoe a humanidade"", concluiu o presidente.
Relação de Lula com papa Francisco
Lula se reuniu com o papa Francisco por algumas vezes. Em 2020, antes de ser candidato ao terceiro mandato como presidente, Lula e Francisco abordaram temas como fome, desigualdade social e intolerância na conversa com o pontífice.
Em 2023, já como presidente, Lula se reuniu com o papa ao lado da primeira-dama Janja da Silva. Eles discutiram temas como a guerra na Ucrânia, mudanças climáticas e combate à fome. 
No ano seguinte, os dois voltaram a se reunir durante visita de Lula à Itália para a cúpula do G7. Lula, mais uma vez acompanhado da primeira-dama Janja, discutiu com Francisco temas como paz mundial, combate à fome e redução das desigualdades. Ele também expressou o desejo de convidar o pontífice para a COP 30 em Belém, em 2025. 
A primeira-dama Janja da Silva também se encontrou com o papa Francisco no Vaticano em fevereiro. Durante a visita, o pontífice perguntou sobre a saúde do presidente Lula e expressou seu apoio à Aliança Global Contra a Fome e a Pobreza, uma iniciativa do governo brasileiro. 
Em uma rede social, Janja mencionou estar muito emocionada e agradeceu pelas orações do papa pela recuperação de Lula. 
Duas semanas depois, Lula e Janja realizaram uma missa na capela do Palácio da Alvorada pela saúde do papa Francisco, que à época, estava internado para tratar uma dupla pneumonia. A missa foi conduzida por três padres jesuítas e contou com a presença de Dom Raymundo Damasceno, Cardeal e Arcebispo Emérito de Aparecida.",https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2025/04/21/lula-e-janja-irao-ao-funeral-do-papa-francisco-em-roma-informa-planalto.ghtml,pt

O padre João Paulo Souto Victor, de Cuité, na Paraíba, relembrou um momento divertido com o papa Francisco, conhecido por seu carisma e espontaneidade. Ao pedir uma bênção para seus conterrâneos, o padre foi surpreendido com uma brincadeira do pontífice. Piada foi relembrada nesta segunda-feira (21), após a morte de Francisco, aos 88 anos.
Em maio de 2021, enquanto caminhava pelo pátio de San Damaso, no Vaticano, o papa foi abordado por João Paulo, que pediu orações pelos brasileiros: “Santo Padre, reze por nós, brasileiros”. Sorrindo, Francisco respondeu com bom humor: “Vocês não têm salvação. É muita cachaça e pouca oração”. Assista o momento:

Após receber a notícia da morte do pontífice, João Paulo destacou a importância de relembrar os momentos de afeto deixados por Francisco. Na época, o vídeo foi publicado nas redes sociais e gerou uma enorme repercussão — inclusive com comentários negativos sobre a fala do papa.
""Como é bom olhar para trás e lembrar, ao longo destes 12 anos de pontificado, os momentos humanos e afetivos do papa, que deixa marcas tão humanas e tão simples na vida de cada um de nós. O papa brincava. Claro que estas ações de Francisco sempre vão repercutir. O papa Francisco deixa um legado de um papa humano, de um papa próximo do povo, de um papa audacioso no ponto de vista da coragem da reforma da Igreja"", destaca o padre João Paulo. 
O padre João Paulo relembrou que o encontro ocorreu quando estudava em Roma. Ele estava acompanhado de outro sacerdote, que registrou o momento em vídeo. 
Segundo ele, aquele instante permanece guardado em seu coração. Embora seja um momento de sofrimento para os cristãos, o padre ressaltou a importância da missão cumprida pelo papa.
“Guardo no meu coração aquele rosto sereno, aquele olhar vibrante, mãos macias, mas que transmitem uma paz muito grande para nós, enquanto Igreja Cristã. Então, este dia é um dia de sofrimento, mas um dia de alegria, no sentido de que nós cremos na vida eterna e sabemos que o santo padre, papa Francisco, cumpriu a sua missão de trazer esperança para nossas vidas em tempos difíceis, em tempos de turbulência”, afirmou o padre João Paulo.

O padre João Paulo afirmou ainda que a Igreja Católica enfrentará o desafio de escolher um novo papa e espera que o sucessor dê continuidade ao legado de Francisco.
“Estamos diante de um desafio, mas também de um tempo novo de esperança; que aquele que venha a substituí-lo seja capaz de dar continuidade ao legado que ele semeou entre nós: o legado da humildade, da simplicidade, mas, acima de tudo, da proximidade”, refletiu o padre.

Jorge Mario Bergoglio, o papa Francisco, morreu aos 88 anos às 2h35 pelo horário de Brasília, 7h35 pelo horário local, desta segunda-feira (21). As informações foram confirmadas pelo Vaticano. O pontífice ocupou o cargo máximo da Igreja Católica por 12 anos.
""O Bispo de Roma, Francisco, retornou à casa do Pai. Toda a sua vida foi dedicada ao serviço do Senhor e de Sua Igreja. Ele nos ensinou a viver os valores do Evangelho com fidelidade, coragem e amor universal, especialmente em favor dos mais pobres e marginalizados. Com imensa gratidão por seu exemplo como verdadeiro discípulo do Senhor Jesus, recomendamos a alma do Papa Francisco ao infinito amor misericordioso do Deus Trino"", diz comunicado oficial.
Francisco se recuperava de uma pneumonia nos dois pulmões após ficar internado por cerca de 40 dias.
Nascido em 17 de dezembro de 1936 em Buenos Aires, na Argentina, Francisco foi o primeiro papa latino-americano da história. Ele também foi o primeiro pontífice da era moderna a assumir o papado após a renúncia do seu antecessor e, ainda, o primeiro jesuíta no posto.
À frente da Igreja Católica por quase 12 anos, Francisco foi o papa número 266. Em 13 de março de 2013, durante o segundo dia do conclave para eleger o substituto de Bento XVI, Bergoglio foi escolhido como o novo líder – inclusive contra a sua própria vontade, segundo ele mesmo admitiu.

Um dos momentos mais marcantes da trajetória de fé e da vida de Daniel Lima, assessor do Conselho Indigenista Missionário (Cimi) e morador de Lábrea, foi o encontro com o papa Francisco durante o Sínodo da Amazônia, em 2019, no Vaticano.
Em entrevista ao g1, o missionário relembra o impacto do pontífice na defesa dos povos tradicionais e pela preservação da Amazônia. Francisco, que morreu nesta segunda-feira (21), aos 88 anos, vítima de um Acidente Vascular Cerebral (AVC) seguido de falência cardíaca, deixou um legado de acolhimento e valorização dos povos originários.
""Francisco sempre colocou os povos originários no centro das discussões"", afirma Daniel, que teve a oportunidade de se encontrar com o pontífice durante o Sínodo da Amazônia, em 2019. 
Lima relembrou com carinho o momento histórico em que teve a chance de representar os povos da Amazônia e debater diretamente com líderes religiosos e indígenas sobre questões essenciais para a região. Para ele, a morte de Francisco marca o fim de um pontificado que, por meio de gestos simbólicos e ações concretas, levou a voz dos povos da floresta até o Vaticano.
Durante seu pontificado, o papa Francisco teve um forte compromisso com a Amazônia, destacando a importância do bioma para o planeta. Em outubro de 2019, ele convocou um Sínodo especial para discutir os desafios enfrentados pela região e a evangelização. 
O evento reuniu bispos e representantes de toda a Pan-Amazônia e se tornou um dos momentos mais importantes de seu papado, com foco na defesa do meio ambiente e dos povos tradicionais.

Assessor do Cimi, entidade ligada à Conferência Nacional dos Bispos do Brasil (CNBB), Daniel descreve o encontro com o papa como um marco importante para a Igreja e para os povos da Amazônia. Durante o Sínodo, Francisco se mostrou acessível e atento às preocupações dos líderes indígenas e comunidades tradicionais. 
""Foi um momento histórico para a Igreja na Amazônia e também para os povos tradicionais. Estavam ali bispos, lideranças indígenas, quilombolas e representantes de comunidades de toda a Pan-Amazônia"", lembrou Daniel.

O missionário também destacou com carinho a convivência com Francisco, que se mostrou acessível e simples durante todo o evento. 
""Ele se aproximava das rodas de conversa, conversava com todos, tratava todos como iguais. Ele transformou o mundo numa paróquia, cuidando de todos como um pai cuida da família"", disse.
A conversa entre Daniel e o papa aconteceu logo nos primeiros dias do Sínodo. Segundo o missionário, um dos temas foi a presença feminina na Igreja, com destaque para Maria Madalena, a quem o papa reconheceu como símbolo de protagonismo e fé.
Outro assunto lembrado foi a escolha de Francisco em manter a cruz simples que usava antes de se tornar papa, como sinal de humildade e proximidade com o povo.
""Ele poderia ter escolhido uma cruz de ouro, mas manteve a que já usava como bispo. Quando perguntaram o motivo, ele respondeu com algo que me marcou muito: que o pastor precisa ter cheiro de ovelha — e ele realmente vivia isso"", relembrou o missionário.

Católico e admirador do pontífice desde o início do pontificado, Daniel diz que viver essa experiência foi “quase inarrável”.
“Desde 2013, quando ele foi eleito, eu já acompanhava com admiração. Quando escolheu o nome Francisco, pensei: vai ser um pontificado diferente. E foi. Ele se inspirava em São Francisco de Assis. Participar desse momento e ter esse contato direto foi muito emocionante"", pontuou.
Sobre o legado de Francisco, o missionário afirma que o papa plantou sementes importantes, principalmente em relação aos povos indígenas.
""Ele foi o primeiro papa a reconhecer os erros históricos da Igreja contra os povos indígenas e a pedir perdão pelos abusos cometidos contra os povos originários em nome da fé cristã. Trouxe os indígenas para o centro das discussões, reconheceu sua importância e ouviu suas vozes. Isso é histórico"".
Por fim, Daniel espera que o sucessor do papa Francisco dê continuidade ao caminho iniciado por ele.
“Espero que o próximo papa cuide da semente que Francisco plantou. Ele estava dando continuidade às reformas iniciadas no Concílio Vaticano II. Que esse caminho continue sendo trilhado"", concluiu. 
Como lembrança daquele encontro inesquecível, Daniel guarda até hoje uma moeda com o brasão do pontificado de Francisco, entregue pelo próprio papa a todos os participantes no último dia do Sínodo.

<p>Climate change is a <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1890909"">pressing reality</a> for Pakistan, directly impacting millions of lives. <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1891214/pms-aide-highlights-escalating-climate-challenges-faced-by-developing-countries"">Heatwaves</a>, intensified by climate change, are becoming more frequent, prolonged and severe, disproportionately affecting communities with limited resources to adapt.</p>
<p>According to the advisory, “The weather is likely to remain dry and hot in most parts of the country.”</p>
<p>In Sindh and Balochistan, the weather will remain dry with temperatures expected to be above normal during the week, the advisory read.</p>
<p>It further said: “The weather was likely to remain hot in most areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir,” adding that rain was expected in various areas of Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and a few districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p>
<p>The advisory noted that “partly cloudy weather with a chance of rain was expected in Abbottabad, Chitral, Dir, Haripur, Kohat, Kohistan, Mohmand, Nowshera, Peshawar, Swat and Waziristan”.</p>
<p>The NDMA said it was continuing to monitor the situation through the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC).</p>
<p>The Pakis­­tan Meteorological Depart­ment (PMD) had <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1903701"">predicted</a> a heatwave earlier this month with higher than normal temperatures from April 14 to 18.</p>

Renowned chef Zakir passes away in Karachi: family,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 12:14:01 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>Renowned <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/authors/4908/chef-zakir"">chef Zakir Qureshi</a> passed away in Karachi last night, his nephew Shayan Qureshi confirmed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The celebrity chef was well-known for his cooking programmes and diverse culinary expertise, having worked at numerous restaurants across the world.</p>
<p>“He [Zakir] passed away in Karachi, at around 7pm last night,” Shayan told <em>Dawn.com</em> about his paternal uncle.</p>
<p>Zakir returned from the United States, where he had been residing for the past five years, 20 days ago, according to Shayan. He added that the culinary icon had been placed on dialysis due to kidney issues.</p>
<p>The chef’s funeral will be offered after Asr prayers today in Karachi’s Saudabad area.</p>

<p>Zakir hosted his namesake television show ‘<a class=""link--external"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=zakir%27s%20kitchen%20%2BDawnNews"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Zakir’s Kitchen</a>’ on <em>DawnNews</em> for several years in the 2010s. He was known to be an individual devoted to his craft.</p>
<p>“I don’t go out and socialise. I don’t have an interest in watching movies or listening to music or anything else… I just know how to cook. Food is my life,” he told  <em>Dawn</em> in a 2014 <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1114017"">interview</a>.</p>
<p>During his life, Zakir <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1114017"">amassed vast experience</a> working at hotels and restaurant kitchens around the globe, including Botswana, the United Arab Emirates, the Caribbean, Singapore and South Africa.</p>

Coalition partners put canals on the negotiating table,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 09:09:04 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>• Second contact between PPP, PML-N leaders in as many days hints at ‘softening of stances’<br />
• Rana Sana says water distribution issue to be resolved on administrative, technical grounds<br />
• Azma criticises Bilawal for ‘harsh remarks’; Ghani accuses PML-N of trying to hurt PPP</p>
<p>KARACHI: As both coalition partners began seeing eye to eye on the <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1892222"">issue of canals</a>, the acrimony caused by the controversial canals on the Indus River continues to rile up their middle-tier leaders, highlighting the extent to which the issue has driven a wedge between them.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1902095/bilawal-says-ppp-will-not-support-govts-unilateral-canal-project"">initial anger</a>, however, seems to have subsided, with both sides agreeing to a dialogue, and two phone calls between the senior leaders of the PPP and the PML-N in as many days showing that both sides have softened their stances, which may pave the way for a consensus.</p>
<p>On Monday, Prime Minister’s adviser Rana Sanaullah and Sindh’s senior minister Sharjeel Memon held a second consecutive telephonic conversation in as many days. Both leaders once again signalled a thaw in frosty ties, reaffirming their commitment to resolving the issue through dialogue.</p>
<p>Later, talking to a private news channel in the evening, Rana Sanaullah said PM Shehbaz Sharif’s government believed in resolving all matters through mutual understanding, and that it was not possible for any province to be deprived of its rightful share.</p>
<p>    <figure class=""media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven"">

<p>“Under the [1991] Water Accord, no pr­o­v­ince’s water can be diverted to an­other, nor is it being done,” he said. “The distribution of water is an administrative and technical issue, and it will be resolved on administrative and technical grounds. Let me be very clear that no province will be deprived of its rights, provincial concerns will be addressed, and the process of consultation will be further expanded.”</p>
<p>Although the Sindh government did not come up with an immediate reaction to the latest response from Islamabad, Infor­ma­tion Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon iss­ued a statement urging mainly nationalist parties — currently staging sit-ins acr­oss the province and blocking roads and highways in protest against the canal project — to ensure that their demonstrations do not cause inconvenience to the public.</p>
<p>“The political parties have a constitutional right to peaceful protest on the issue of the canal,” the statement quoted Mr Memon as saying. “Demonstrations, rallies, processions — whatever form a party chooses to protest in — they should inform the government and hold their protests in open spaces or areas where the public does not face inconvenience. The protest and dissent are the essence of every democracy, but the protest should not cause trouble for the public.”</p>
<p>However, the Sindh minister is scheduled to hold a press conference today, in which he is expected to address the canals issue.</p>
<p><strong>Unabated criticism</strong></p>
<p>Despite all the headway, unless the engagement between the two sides translates into a tangible outcome, the exchange of criticism from both ends is likely to continue unabated. It was Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari who first took a potshot at PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, criticising him for his “harsh” remarks.</p>
<p>The minister said if Punjab did not purchase wheat under its policy, it didn’t leave the farmers helpless either. Punjab’s farmers will be given a Rs100 billion package, Rs5,000 per acre, and a Rs25 billion wheat programme. Punjab’s farmers have been given Kisan Cards, thousands of tractors, and super seeders.</p>
<p>“It is unfortunate that no one has spoken about the condition of Sindh’s farmers. Neither was a wheat price fixed nor were Kisan Cards issued. In contrast, the Punjab government has taken multiple steps for the welfare of farmers.”</p>
<p><strong>‘No compromise’</strong></p>
<p>Hours later, senior PPP leader and Sindh minister Saeed Ghani strongly criticised the PML-N, accusing it of “deliberately attempting” to weaken his party over the controversial canal project. Speaking to the media in Karachi, Mr Ghani made it clear that the PPP would not compromise on the construction of new canals.</p>
<p>    <figure class=""media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven"">
        <div class=""media__item  media__item--newskitlink  "">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>“It seems PML-N wants to harm the PPP. They must remove any notion from their minds that we will accept the canal projects through negotiations. We categorically reject them,” he said.</p>
<p>According to Mr Ghani, President Asif Ali Zardari holds no executive power under the Constitution, and in Pakistan’s parliamentary system, such powers lie with the prime minister. However, even the PM does not have the authority to decide water distribution, he added.</p>
<p>“President Zardari publicly opposed the canal projects in the joint session of parliament. Opposition parties are beating drums over something no one actually heard,” he said while responding to criticism about President Zardari’s alleged support for the project in a “closed-door meeting”.</p>

X rival Bluesky adds blue checks for trusted accounts,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:57:07 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>X <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1872925"">rival</a> Bluesky on Monday said it was adding blue checks to accounts that have been verified to confirm users are who they claim to be.</p>
<p>In a blog post, the company said it would “proactively verify authentic and notable accounts and display a blue check next to their names”.</p>
<p>“Trust is everything,” the team said in the post.</p>
<p>The move mirrors a feature once deployed at Twitter in an effort to thwart imposters and help users know when account holders were authentic.</p>
<p>    <figure class=""media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven"">

<p>Billionaire Elon Musk <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1749015"">did away</a> with verifying who was behind accounts after he bought Twitter, now called X, in 2022.</p>
<p>Instead, Musk offered blue check marks to those paying for subscriptions for an X Premium tier on the social network.</p>
<p>“Social media has connected us in powerful ways, but it hasn’t always given us the tools to know who we’re interacting with or why we should trust them,” the Bluesky team said in its post.</p>
<p>Bluesky was created by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey as a side project in 2019.</p>
<p>Dorsey pulled five engineers aside to build a decentralised alternative to Twitter.</p>
<p>He said at the time that centralised attempts to police abuse and misinformation on a platform like Twitter were unlikely to work, and that he wanted to give users more control of personal data and content moderation.</p>
<p>Bluesky did not see the light of day until 2023, the year after Twitter was bought by Musk — a key ally of US President Donald Trump who has pushed misinformation on his platform since his takeover.</p>
<p>Bluesky said in a post early this year that it had grown to more than 30 million users.</p>
<p>The burgeoning social media network already lets individuals and organisations verify who they are by letting them use their website addresses as their user names, and more than 270,000 accounts use that option, according to the platform.</p>
<p>Bluesky is starting out such “trusted verifiers” with blue checks and plans to eventually launch a request form for accounts seeking the mark of authenticity, the team said.</p>
<p>Bluesky’s chief operating officer Rose Wang said in a recent interview with <em>AFP</em> that she was optimistic about the social network’s trajectory.</p>
<p>“We really see this as our coming-out year,” she said.</p>

<p>While half of this portfolio was legacy <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1850574"">rollovers</a> from China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — fresh loans and grant inflows amounted to $5.51bn in nine months, almost 20pc lower than the comparable period of last fiscal year.</p>
<p>In its monthly report on Foreign Economic Assistance (FEA) released on Monday, the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) said that against its annual target of $19.4bn, total FEA in July-March amounted to $5.51bn compared to $6.9bn in the same period last year with the annual target of $17.6bn.</p>
<p>This does not include about $1bn disbursed by the IMF in October as upfront payment under the $7bn ongoing Extended Fund Facility (EFF) that is accounted for separately by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). However, $1.2bn received a year back under the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) had also seen similar accounting treatment.</p>
<blockquote class=""blockquote-level-1"">
<p>Expected inflow of $9bn from Saudi Arabia and China critical to meet external funding gap in FY25</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With three rollovers and fresh disbursements, the total external assistance in nine months amounted to $12.46bn. This included $3bn rollovers by Saudi Arabia, $2bn by UAE and $1bn by China. This does not include another $2bn China rolled over last month, making its total rollover to $3bn thus far. Pakistan has a total annual rollover portfolio of about $12.7bn in safe deposits and loans from these three countries, leaving the country’s net international reserves (NIR) at a deficit.</p>
<p>The foreign economic assistance recorded by the EAD showed inflows fell by about 20.2pc to about $5.5bn in July-March, apparently because of delayed IMF bailout and subsequent $1bn disbursements. Last year, these inflows amounted to $7.9bn in these nine months, including IMF.</p>
<p>In March this year, the EAD reported monthly inflows at $555 million, compared to $365m in February and $830m in January.</p>
<p>The EAD said that out of $5.5b, about $3bn was received for budgetary support or programme loans and the remaining $2.4bn for project financing. During the same period last year, EAD secured about $2.2bn as project aid and $4.7bn as programme loans.</p>
<p>Of the total, inflows from multilaterals stood at $2.83bn in 9MFY25 compared to $2.7bn last year, while bilateral disbursements stood at $358.5m against $870m last year.</p>
<p>The EAD reported to have received about $504m in loans from foreign commercial lenders (UAE-based) in nine months of the current year, showing a minor recovery from commercial banks who had stayed away from financing Pakistan last year. It may be noted that the government has budgeted $3.8bn in financing from foreign commercial banks for the current year, showing a poor start, again due to the delayed IMF umbrella.</p>
<p>The government has also targeted $1bn in international bonds for the current year. A projection for $9bn inflow from China and Saudi Arabia was targeted for FY25. These projections include a $5bn time deposit from Saudi Arabia and $4bn China’s SAFE deposit. These projections are critical for Pakistan to meet its external financing gap as part of the IMF programme.</p>
<p>In addition, Pakistan also received $1.455bn from overseas Pakistanis through Naya Pakistan Certificates compared to $781m in the same period last year.</p>
<p>The Asian Development Bank disbursed $1.189bn in 9MFY25 compared to $665m a year ago, and $979m was received from the World Bank.</p>

‘Held ex-PAF officer was convicted of mutiny’,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:15:52 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>ISLAMABAD: A retired air marshal, who was arrested last year, has been convicted on a number of charges, including mutiny, and is being detained at a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) mess, a PAF representative informed the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday.</p>
<p>Retired <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1417817#:~:text=Air%20Vice%20Marshal%20Javad%20Saeed"">Air Marshal Javad Saeed</a> was arrested in January 2024, after which his spouse filed a habeas corpus petition for his recovery.</p>
<p>At the time, IHC Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro dismissed the petition and imposed a fine of Rs25,000 on the petitioner as PAF authorities disclosed that Saeed was court-martialled and convicted under the Official Secrets Act.</p>
<p>    <figure class=""media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven"">
        <div class=""media__item  media__item--newskitlink  "">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The judge remarked that since Saeed’s whereabouts were already known, a habeas corpus petition could not be filed for his recovery.</p>
<p>Then, last month, Saeed’s spouse filed a review application against the dismissal and sought his release from PAF’s custody.</p>
<p>The petition stated that after the arrest, Saeed’s pension was stopped, and the government-provided family health services were also discontinued. But later, his wife’s medical treatment was restored.</p>
<p><strong>The hearing</strong></p>
<p>During the hearing of the review application on Monday, a PAF official told the court that Saeed was detained under the Official Secrets Act.</p>
<p>After a court-martial by a PAF tribunal, he was sentenced to 14 years’ imprisonment. The air chief has reduced the sentence by 10 years and Saeed was serving the remaining four-year term.</p>
<p>The PAF official informed IHC that Saeed was detai­ned at an Officers’ Mess instead of a prison, where army officers serve their sentences after conviction as per law.</p>
<p>The petitioner’s counsel, retired Col Inamur Rahim, arg­ued that Saeed was being kept in illegal custody by PAF. He said that as a constitutional court, the IHC was duty-bound to set aside the “unlawful confinement”.</p>
<p>He pointed out that following the conviction, convicts were sent to jail to complete the sentence. However, the PAF kept Saeed in its own custody.</p>
<p>Advocate Rahim said that Saeed was among the contenders for the post of air chief in 2021, but retired from service on March 18, 2021, after he was not promoted as air chief. The officer was taken into custody on January 1, 2024, the lawyer added.</p>
<p>Being a civilian, he could not be tried by the PAF Tribunal, he argued, adding that despite his conviction, Saeed was not handed over to jail authorities.</p>
<p>The PAF official informed the judge that the air chief had declared the Officer’s Mess as sub-jail. Therefore, Saeed was detained there in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Mr Rahim contested the assertion, saying such confinement was illegal.</p>
<p>He also said that authorities did not share details of the court-martial proceedings, leaving the convict unable to file an appeal in court.</p>
<p>The judge then directed PAF to share relevant details with the counsel and adjourned the hearing till April 29.</p>

Saffron to be cultivated in Swat on experimental basis: officials,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 11:06:23 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>SWAT: Agriculture officials have said that they have planned to conduct trial cultivation of saffron in lower Swat and Kalam to evaluate its feasibility and explore necessary adaptations in production techniques.</p>
<p>They were addressing a two-day training workshop on saffron cultivation and management at Agriculture Research Institute (ARI) in Swat.</p>
<p>The training was <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1826426"">organised</a> under a project titled ‘introduction and promotion of saffron in potential districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’.</p>
<p>Farmers from various parts of Swat participated in the workshop.</p>
<p>Adnan Ahmad, research officer at ARI and focal person for the saffron project, said that the initiative was part of a wider effort to introduce saffron in suitable agro-climatic zones of the province.</p>
<p>“Under the project, three training sessions are being held across KP. One was conducted in Mansehra, the second has just concluded here in Swat, and the third will be organised in Karak,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr Ahmad said that saffron cultivation required specific environmental conditions such as dry temperate climates with minimal monsoon rainfall. “We are <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1800490"">training farmers</a> to understand what saffron is and how it can be cultivated in particular ecological settings. Although Swat has a comparatively moist climate, we plan to conduct trial cultivation in lower Swat and Kalam to evaluate its feasibility and explore necessary adaptations in production techniques,” he added.</p>
<p>Zakriya Bacha, research officer at ARI, said that the training was well-received by local farms. “Farmers from across the district attended it with enthusiasm. Since saffron is a relatively new crop for this region, both farmers and researchers are keen to explore its potential. We will begin cultivation on an experimental basis and closely monitor the results,” he added.</p>
<p>    <figure class=""media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven"">
        <div class=""media__item  media__item--newskitlink  "">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The farmers, who attended the training, expressed optimism about the initiative. They acknowledged saffron’s profitability and global demand and showed willingness to adopt the new crop if the trials proved successful.</p>
<p>The introduction of saffron in Swat aligns with the provincial government’s broader goal of promoting high-value crops to boost rural economy, enhance livelihoods and reduce reliance on traditional, low-profit agriculture.</p>

"Focus on recovery, reforms as Aurangzeb meets IMF, World Bank heads","Tue, 22 Apr 2025 07:47:48 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>WASHINGTON: Finance Mini­ster Muhammad Aurangzeb met the heads of the IMF and World Bank on Monday to kick off a series of high-level consultations in Washington.</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb is in the US capital to <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1905259/aurangzeb-leaves-for-us-to-attend-imf-world-bank-meetings"">attend</a> the <a class=""link--external"" href=""https://meetings.imf.org/en/2025/Spring"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">2025 Spring Meetings</a> of the IMF and the World Bank Group, which brought together finance ministers and central bank governors from 191 countries to address global challenges such as sovereign debt, climate finance and reforming the international financial system.</p>
<p>The delegation, led by the finance minister, is scheduled to meet officials of global financial institutions, development partners, and major bilateral creditors.</p>
<p>Discussions with the IMF and World Bank chiefs focused on Pakistan’s economic recovery plan, structural reforms, and the future of ongoing programmes.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources told <em>Dawn</em> that the talks were “constructive”.</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb’s meeting with the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, was expected to positively influence the creditor’s review of Pakistan’s <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1860850"">$7 billion</a> Extended Fund Facility.</p>
<p>Pakistan is seeking the release of a <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1897968"">second tranche</a> of $1 billion. An IMF review mission is due in Pakistan on May 14.</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb also met the World Bank president, Ajay Banga, to discuss development financing and Pakistan’s medium-term reform priorities, including fiscal consolidation and energy sector reforms.</p>
<p>The minister has had half a dozen meetings since arriving in Washington on Sunday.</p>
<p>Some key engagements scheduled over the coming days include talks with Chinese, US, Saudi Arabia, UAE and European officials, as well as with commercial banks, global credit rating agencies, and multilateral lenders such as the Asian Development Bank.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>A meeting with Chinese Finance Minister Lan Fo’an later this week will focus on Pakistan’s request to reschedule the debt of $3.4bn — an effort to ease pressure on the country’s foreign financing needs.</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb is also expected to meet senior US Treasury officials, including Robert Kaproth, the assistant secretary for International Finance, and James C. Cruse, the acting president of the US Exim Bank.</p>
<p>A central item on the agenda will be the $3bn financing gap for the Reko Diq copper and gold project.</p>
<p>The Exim Bank has expressed interest in offering $1bn in loan, contingent on receiving preferential creditor status — a condition that Pakistan has not yet agreed to.</p>
<p>The finance minister is also scheduled to engage with Mohamed Nasheed, the secretary general of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, for discussions on climate finance and disaster resilience.</p>
<p>On Monday, Mr Aurangzeb also met the representatives of Deloitte, one of the Big Four accounting firms, and briefed them on Pakistan’s macroeconomic outlook, development priorities, and export-led growth agenda.</p>
<p>The discussions included energy reforms, the extraction and marketing of critical minerals, privatisation, technology and crypto regulation, and the operationalisation of the Country Partnership Fram­ework.</p>
<p>The minister welcomed Deloitte’s planned visit to Pakistan in May 2025.</p>
<p>Officials in Washington have said that Pakistan’s objective during the talks was not only to secure funding but also strengthen long-term partnerships that support sustainable economic reforms.</p>

PTI-JUI gulf widens despite overtures,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 07:55:23 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>• Ayub says party can’t force Maulana to join ‘grand alliance’<br />
• Fazl willing to engage with PTI, party seeks clarity on Imran’s ‘green-light for talks’</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: The gulf between reluctant allies — the PTI and JUI-F — has widened to the point that leaders from Imran Khan’s party seem to have lost hope of launching a much-touted <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1891429"">joint struggle</a> alongside the religio-political outfit led by Maulana Fazlur Rehman.</p>
<p>This was evidenced by Opposition Leader Omar Ayub’s recent admission that they would forge ahead with their agitation, as they could not force the Maulana to join their ‘grand alliance’.</p>
<p>“We will take our caravan and move forward. Whoever comes in the caravan is fine, we will not force Maulana Sahib to support us,” he said during an appearance on <em>DawnNewsTV</em> on Monday.</p>
<p>He said the Maulana had his own political party, and if he did not want to join hands with the PTI, then it was his decision to make.</p>
<p>The PTI had earlier been quite confident that it would be able to win over the veteran politician from Dera Ismail Khan with help from their allies in the Tehreek Tahaffuz Aayen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) alliance.</p>
<p>However, the recent brouhaha over whether the incarcerated PTI founder was willing to cut a deal with the establishment for his release seems to have driven a wedge between the two parties.</p>
<p>Recently, PTI leader Azam Swati  — whose previous allegiances include the JUI-F  — <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1902573"">claimed</a> he had Imran Khan’s blessing to approach the establishment for talks. However, while this impression was refuted by other party leaders such as Salman Akram Raja and Omar Ayub, the JUI-F took exception and sought clarity from the PTI.</p>
<p>    <figure class=""media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven"">
        <div class=""media__item  media__item--newskitlink  "">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>For his part, the Maulana’s recent remarks have indicated a cooling of tensions with PTI. During his press talk alongside the Jamaat-i-Islami chief in Mansoora on Monday, he expressed a willingness to “mend relations with the PTI to an extent where political dialogue is possible and national issues discussed”.</p>
<p>The veteran politician said that while they also had political differences with the PPP and PML-N, this should not be construed as a personal enmity.</p>
<p>“In the same spirit, we also want our relations with the PTI to be cordial enough to carry on political dialogue,” the Maulana said.</p>
<p>But according to JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza, the party wants a definitive answer on whether the PTI seeks to launch an anti-government drive, or cosy up with the powers that be. In an earlier appearance on <em>DawnNewsTV</em>, Senator Murtaza had indicated that the JUI-F chief was ready to disengage with the PTI over this.</p>
<p>“The JUI-F might not join the opposition alliance if the PTI has decided to engage with the establishment,” he had said.</p>
<p>“If an alliance between the two parties is formed, then all decisions will need to be taken in light of party discipline,” Senator Murtaza claimed, adding that decisions would be taken through consensus in such a case.</p>
<p>On Monday, Mr Ayub again denied the impression that his party was pursing the establishment, saying that no dialogue was taking place, nor were any attempts being made to initiate such talks.</p>
<p>However, he maintained that all parties that were part of the TTAP alliance — led by PkMAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai — would be taken on board in case such a move was on the cards.</p>
<p>Mr Ayub refused to answer when asked, point blank, whom these talks would be held with.</p>

<p>With Kings reeling at 133-8, needing 15 off 12, Khushdil’s (23 not out off 17, three fours) nerveless assault on a tricky, low-bounce pitch turned the tide, providing them with the finishing touch after skipper David Warner’s gritty maiden PSL fifty (60 off 47, eight fours) and a spirited Zalmi fightback led by Luke Wood (3-28).</p>
<p>Entering the match with Kings at two wins from four and Zalmi at one from three, this triumph, in the final game in the metropolis this season, bolstered Kings’ playoff hopes.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The chase was a rollercoaster, defined by Khushdil’s late heroics and a tense climax. Warner, the season’s biggest signing of the league, set the tone, as the southpaw battled seam and low bounce with deft drives and ramps, notably against Ali Raza (2-32), whom he plundered for three fours in the 14th over, including a ramp to fine leg and a slash past point.</p>
<p>His fifty, reached with a slice to deep point off Arif Yaqoob (1-18), steadied Kings at 107-5 before Wood’s back-of-the-hand slower ball, however, clean-bowled Warner in the 17th over, sparking Zalmi’s wild celebrations as Kings needed 29 off 21. Abbas Afridi and Aamer Jamal fell quickly, leaving Khushdil to face the pressure at 133-8.</p>
<p>In scintillating form this season, Khushdil rose to the occasion. Against Ali, he played cautiously, nurdling singles to keep the chase alive, but unleashed his power against Hussain Talat in the final over, as they required nine to win.</p>
<p>A hammered four past backward point off a short, wide ball set the tone, and after a single, Hasan Ali’s (six not out off three) exquisite pull for another boundary sealed the win for Karachi, sparking delirium among the raucous crowd, whose energy outshone the leg’s earlier matches.</p>
<p>Earlier, Tim Seifert fell on the very first ball to Wood, James Vince (11 off nine, two fours) nicked off, and Saad Baig was bowled by Ali. Mohammad Nabi (14 off 11, a four and a six) and Irfan Khan (10 off 16) kept Kings’ hopes alive but Arif’s spin and a run-out tightened the screws, making Khushdil’s composure pivotal.</p>
<p>Earlier after being put into bat, Zalmi posted a fighting 147-8, setting the stage for a tense chase on a bowler-friendly pitch.</p>
<p>The Zalmi innings, marked by disciplined bowling from Kings and flashes of resilience from Babar Azam and Alzarri Joseph, unfolded as a tale of survival and sporadic defiance.</p>
<p>Kings unleashed their pace battery with Mir Hamza (1-14) setting the tone. His opening spell was a masterclass, exploiting early swing and seam to keep Zalmi openers, Babar and Saim Ayub, on a leash.</p>
<p>Hamza’s probing lines accounted for Saim, who fell to a rash shot, caught by Vince at backward point. Babar, surviving an early lbw scare via review, battled through a testing powerplay, managing 19 off 25 by the sixth over, but the pitch’s behaviour stifled fluency.</p>
<p>The middle overs saw Zalmi wrestle for momentum. Tom Kohler-Cadmore’s brief stay at the crease ended with a stunning catch by Irfan off Khushdil (3-20), whose crafty spin dismantled Zalmi’s core.</p>
<p>Babar, anchoring the innings, found rhythm with elegant drives, amassing 46 off 41, including seven fours. Yet, his attempt to accelerate was thwarted by Khushdil’s quicker delivery, trapping him lbw in the 10th over — a crucial blow.</p>
<p>Mohammad Haris (28 off 21) injected impetus with audacious strokeplay but Abbas’ (3-30) cunning slower ball sent him packing, caught by Warner.</p>
<p>Kings’ bowlers maintained relentless pressure. Abbas excelled at the death, dismissing Hussain (18 off 16) and Wood, while Khushdil’s guile removed Mitchell Owen.</p>
<p>With Zalmi reeling at 111-5 after 16 overs, Alzarri Joseph’s late flourish (24 not out off 13, two fours and a six) provided a lifeline. His muscular hits, alongside a few wayward deliveries from Hasan, pushed Zalmi close to 150 — a total that, given the pitch’s challenges, proved just short.</p>

Rawalpindi health workers’ protest against hospitals outsourcing mars anti-polio campaign,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 11:22:17 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>RAWALPINDI: As the district launched its <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1905470"">week-long polio vaccination</a> drive on Monday, health workers in at least three tehsils – Kahuta, Kallar Syedan, and Gujar Khan – refused to participate in the campaign to protest the decision to outsource public-sector hospitals.</p>
<p>According to Young Doctors Association’s office-bearer Dr Aarif Aziz, the notification for the outsourcing of the Jinnah Hospital Lahore had been issued while there was a plan to outsource different departments of Mayo Hospital Lahore.</p>
<p>The staff of the basic health units and tehsil headquarters hospitals in these tehsils boycotted the anti-polio drive and staged protests in their respective areas. They demanded that the government withdraw the plan to outsource hospitals and basic health units in the tehsils. They also expressed solidarity with the Young Doctors Association for their protest against the outsourcing of hospitals.</p>
<p>In Rawalpindi city, the sanitary patrol and school nutrition supervisors also expressed their resentment against the decision and warned they would not become part of the polio as well as dengue campaigns in protest.</p>
<blockquote class=""blockquote-level-1"">
<p>Health workers in Kahuta, Gujar Khan, Kallar Syedan tehsils in Pindi district boycott drive, urge govt to withdraw plan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the boycott, the campaign was suspended in some parts of the district, prompting the administration to approach the Punjab government for help.</p>
<p>District Health Authority Chief Executive Officer Dr Asif Arbab Niazi said they had already made arrangements to run the drive in the affected tehsils. He acknowledged there was a shortage of 2,500 workers in these tehsils in light of the protest.</p>
<p>In order to fill this gap, the health authority has sought 1,500 officials from the education department, 1,200 from the nursing college, and 300 from the revenue department, he said, adding that a total of 3,000 people would be at the disposal of the health authority to run the campaign.</p>
<p>He said that the stationary teams at railway stations, the airport, and bus stations were working as per their plan, adding that there was no issue in the city areas and the district authority had sought the help of the local political leadership to supervise the campaign. He said that the district administration had asked all the departments to help the authority make the campaign successful.</p>
<p><em>APP</em> adds: The Islamabad administration also launched its campaign aiming to vaccinate 461,125 children aged up to five years.</p>
<p>According to the state-run agency, the campaign will run for seven days, during which health workers will go door-to-door to administer oral polio drops to children.</p>
<p>Officials said that during the campaign, more than 461,000 children across Islamabad will be given the polio vaccine, with a special focus on urban slums, border areas with Rawalpindi, and locations with high population mobility.</p>
<p>It said polio teams from Islamabad and Rawalpindi will work jointly in the border areas to prevent any missed cases, especially in the transit and high-risk zones.</p>
<p>The vaccination teams will also be present at major bus terminals and other public spaces, and camps will be set up at points where families and children frequently travel, ensuring that those on the move are not left out of the drive.</p>
<p>On the occasion, Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon directed that all vaccination teams must be provided full security. Police and other law enforcement personnel have been tasked to escort the teams and ensure their safety, especially in sensitive areas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Islamabad administration asked community leaders and school officials to play their part in spreading awareness and encouraging participation. Authorities said that awareness efforts are key to countering misinformation and building trust in the vaccine.</p>
<p>In the coming days, district officials will monitor the progress of the campaign through regular field visits. Mobile teams will also be deployed to cover remote and underserved areas. These teams will move from one locality to another to make sure every child is vaccinated, regardless of where they live. According to health officials, the children who miss the vaccine this week will be identified and followed up on in the next round. A reporting and feedback system has been set up to track such cases and ensure they are not left behind.</p>

Farmer kills boy for taking bath at his tubewell in Punjab’s Vehari,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:46:01 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>BAHAWALPUR: A farmer allegedly shot a 13-year-old boy dead for taking a bath at his tubewell at Chak 429/EB in the limits of Sheikh Fazil Police Station of Burewala in Vehari district.</p>

<p>According to police spokesperson Adnan Tariq, Irshad Ahmed Butt complained in his FIR that his grandson, Muhammad Zaki (13), accompanied him on his motorcycle to the tubewell of a farmer Muhammad Tariq.</p>

<p>According to the complainant, several boys were bathing on the tube well and his grandson was standing nearby. Meanwhile, Tariq appeared and started shouting that he had restrained the boys from taking bath at his tube well. He opened fire at Zaki and injured him.</p>

<p>The boy was rushed to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital, Burewala, where he succumbed to his injuries.</p>

<p>The PRO claimed that police had arrested Tariq three hours after the murder. The postmortem was yet to be conducted at the THQ hospital when this report was filed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a man was killed and two others suffered serious injuries in a clash over an enmity between two rival groups at Mehtab Chowk in Hasilpur.</p>

<p>The deceased was identified as Idrees while the injured were Muhammad Sharif and Rehmat.</p>

<p><strong>ENCOUNTER:</strong> A robber involved in over 50 cases of crime was killed while a constable suffered injuries in an encounter near Khairpur Tamewali.</p>

<p>According to police, the robber, Ghulam Mustafa, and his two accomplices allegedly snatched a motorcycle from one Rizwan who along with his two friends was standing by the roadside and fled. When police were informed on 15, a team rushed to the scene and cordoned off the area.</p>

<p>During the exchange of fire, one of the robbers was killed while Constable Muhammad Amin suffered serious injuries. When the firing stopped, Ghulam Mustafa, a resident of Inayati, was found dead.</p>

<p>The police claimed that he was killed by the firing of his accomplices. His body as well as Constable Amin were shifted to THQ Hospital Khairpur Tamewali.</p>

<p>A case was registered against the deceased suspect’s two accomplices.</p>

<p><strong>HOSPITAL WITHOUT POWER:</strong> The Multan Electric Power Company (Mepco) disconnected power connection to the THQ Mailsi over the default of Rs10m dues.</p>

Iran accuses Israel of undermining US nuclear talks,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 09:06:48 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>TEHRAN: Iran accused Israel on Monday of seeking to “undermine” <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1905401/iran-us-wrap-up-nuclear-talks-plan-next-round"">ongoing talks</a> with the United States on its nuclear programme, a key point of tension with the West.</p>
<p>“A kind of coalition is forming… to undermine and disrupt the diplomatic process,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei told reporters, saying Israel was behind the effort.</p>
<p>“Alongside it are a series of warmongering currents in the United States and figures from different factions,” the spokesman added.</p>
<p><em>The New York Times</em> reported on Thursday that US President Donald Trump had dissuaded Israel from striking Iran’s nuclear sites in the short term.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Israel would never allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Western powers and Israel, considered by experts the only nuclear-armed state in the Middle East, have long accused Tehran of seeking nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Iran has always denied the charge, insisting its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes only.</p>
<p>In 2018, Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a landmark nuclear deal signed three years earlier that eased sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.  A year later, Iran began to gradually breach the terms of the deal, most notably by enriching uranium to high levels.</p>
<p>According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Tehran has enriched uranium to 60 per cent, close to the 90pc level needed to manufacture weapons, and continues to accumulate large stocks of fissile material.</p>
<p>The 2015 nuclear deal restricted it to 3.67 percent.</p>

H2(N)O: Nor any drop to drink for Karachi’s other half,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:59:55 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>At the crack of dawn, around 6am, Amina is already in line with two buckets. She’ll wait nearly an hour for water — if it comes. If not, she’ll walk 15 minutes to a neighbour who sells it by the jerrycan. She does this every day before making breakfast for her family.</p>
<p>During the day, when her five-year-old needs to use the toilet, she’ll walk him to the end of the lane where a few families share a makeshift bathroom. It has no door, no water, and no drainage. In her neighbourhood, like many of Karachi’s informal settlements, clean water and safe sanitation access is a daily struggle.</p>
<p>Amina’s story isn’t unique. It reflects the everyday reality of millions of people in Karachi’s <em>katchi abadis</em> (informal settlements) that house nearly half the city’s population. These communities are often lumped together, treated as a single, uniform category in policy discussions, as if every <em>katchi abadi</em> faces the same conditions and challenges. But in truth, they vary widely in how much access they have to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services.</p>
<p>Our recent <a class=""link--external"" href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4505/adb453"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">study</a> of five informal settlements across Karachi reveals just how stark these differences can be. If Karachi is serious about addressing its water and sanitation crisis, the solution does not lie in billion-rupee mega-projects. Real change must begin in the city’s most underserved communities, where even modest investments can dramatically improve daily life for millions.

<h2><a class=""heading-permalink"" href=""#a-tale-of-two-settlements"" id=""a-tale-of-two-settlements"" title=""Permalink""></a>A tale of two settlements</h2>
<p>Consider the contrast between Manzoor Colony and Ilyas Goth.</p>
<p>Manzoor Colony, a settlement regularised in the early 1990s with <a class=""link--external"" href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956247806069626"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">support from the Orangi Pilot Project</a>, has basic but functioning infrastructure. Nearly every household has piped water, flush toilets, and overhead storage tanks. As a result, residents report fewer waterborne illnesses compared to other settlements.</p>
<p>Ilyas Goth, by contrast, is a small settlement located next to an open sewer. No household has piped water or a private toilet. Residents collect water from neighbours or a nearby <em>dhaba</em>, using only around 13 litres per person per day. This is not just below international benchmarks; it is lower than usage in other water-scarce areas of Karachi and falls beneath the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) <a class=""link--external"" href=""https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/water-sanitation-and-health/environmental-health-in-emergencies/humanitarian-emergencies"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">emergency minimum of 15 litres per person per day</a> used in disaster zones. Sanitation access is equally dire. Only one public toilet exists in the entire community, reserved for women and costing Rs20 per use. Unsurprisingly, three out of four households in Ilyas Goth reported a waterborne illness in the past two months.</p>
<h2><a class=""heading-permalink"" href=""#does-legal-recognition-help-it-depends"" id=""does-legal-recognition-help-it-depends"" title=""Permalink""></a>Does legal recognition help? It depends</h2>
<p>A key difference between these two settlements is their status in the eyes of the state. Manzoor Colony is regularised, whereas Ilyas Goth is not. But our <a class=""link--external"" href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4505/adb453"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">study</a> suggests that legal recognition, also known as regularisation, is neither a pre-requisite nor a guarantee of better WASH outcomes.</p>
<p>Take Sherpao Basti, for example. Though unregularised, this settlement is located near the affluent KDA Scheme 1 and fares better than many regularised neighbourhoods. Two-thirds of households have piped water, and nearly all have on-premises flush toilets. In fact, water availability is high enough that residents from neighbouring settlements often come here to collect water.</p>
<p>Compare that with Quaid-i-Azam Colony, a recently regularised settlement that still struggles. Only one-third of households have piped water, and the rest rely on costly private borewells. Despite its legal status, this community has yet to see the benefits that regularisation is assumed to bring.</p>
<p>    <figure class=""media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven"">
        <div class=""media__item  media__item--newskitlink  "">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<h2><a class=""heading-permalink"" href=""#the-missing-link--institutional-fragmentation"" id=""the-missing-link--institutional-fragmentation"" title=""Permalink""></a>The missing link — institutional fragmentation</h2>
<p>Why does regularisation not always improve service access? The answer lies in how Karachi’s institutions have evolved.</p>
<p>As one Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) official explained: “Before 1996, water and sewage services in Karachi were managed as part of the KMC. Since KMC was often involved in the land acquisition process for regularisation, this allowed water and sanitation to be considered within that process. But in 1996, KWSC [Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation] became a separate utility, and it’s no longer involved in regularisation.”</p>
<p>In earlier decades, even though the Sindh Katchi Abadis Act did not formally require the water utility to provide services during regularisation, the city government’s integrated structure meant that WASH needs were still addressed. But today, with KWSC operating separately, that connection has broken down. Newly regularised settlements are left in a limbo, recognised by the land department but ignored by the service provider.</p>
<p>These institutional shifts make it clear that regularisation, without clear mandates for service provision, is not enough. Karachi needs to amend its processes to ensure that the utility and relevant government bodies are jointly responsible for delivering basic services to regularised settlements.</p>
<h2><a class=""heading-permalink"" href=""#more-than-pipes-and-toilets"" id=""more-than-pipes-and-toilets"" title=""Permalink""></a>More than pipes and toilets</h2>
<p>While regularisation and basic infrastructure are often seen as milestones of progress, even in settlements where these boxes are checked, residents continue to face unsafe conditions. Having taps and toilets does not always mean people have safe water or hygienic sanitation. In four of the five settlements we studied, most households technically used improved water sources and sanitation facilities. The infrastructure was there: piped connections, on-premises toilets, and in some cases, water storage systems.</p>
<p>But dig a little deeper, and a different story emerges. Intermittent water supply and poor-quality internal plumbing often result in cross-contamination between sewage and drinking water lines. Household-level water treatment is rare. Combined, this means that even with infrastructure in place, the water reaching people’s homes may be unsafe to drink. The result is a continued burden of disease, especially among children and the elderly, and rising health expenditures that low-income households can ill afford.</p>
<p>    <figure class=""media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven"">
        <div class=""media__item  media__item--newskitlink  "">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<h2><a class=""heading-permalink"" href=""#targeted-interventions-not-mega-projects"" id=""targeted-interventions-not-mega-projects"" title=""Permalink""></a>Targeted interventions, not mega projects</h2>
<p>Understanding why some settlements fare better than others is key to designing smarter, more equitable policies. Yet the default policy response remains the same. Policymakers continue to favour large-scale infrastructure projects, such as new pipelines and desalination plants.</p>
<p>Our findings suggests a better path forward. Improved governance, targeted investments, and community-centred solutions can yield far more sustainable outcomes. For instance, building gender-inclusive, community-managed sanitation facilities could improve both public health and dignity. Promoting low-cost household water treatment, through filters or chlorination, can significantly reduce disease burden. Supporting modest upgrades to internal plumbing networks can eliminate sources of contamination. These are not massive interventions, but they address the root causes of inequality more effectively than projects that bypass the city’s most vulnerable residents.</p>
<p>To achieve lasting change, Karachi must adopt a more comprehensive approach to regularisation. Legal recognition must go hand in hand with actual service delivery. This means mandating that public utilities provide WASH services after a settlement is regularised. It also requires dedicated funding for improving internal infrastructure and support for civil society organisations that bridge the gap between residents and the state.</p>
<p>Not all of Karachi’s informal settlements are the same. Some are holding on. Others are struggling to survive. But all are asking for more than just a dot on the map or a connection to the main line. They need services that are safe, reliable, and affordable. If Karachi is to become a more equitable and resilient city, policymakers must move beyond infrastructure and performative legislation, and commit to meaningful, people-centred reform.</p>

Trump backs Hegseth after second scandal of sharing info on chat,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 08:26:49 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>• Democrats insist US defence secretary ‘must resign in disgrace’<br />
• Pentagon officials fired following probe over Yemen scandal</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump stands behind US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Monday, after <a class=""link--external"" href=""https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/20/politics/hegseth-second-signal-chat-military-plans/index.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">reports</a> that he shared details of a <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1898494"">March attack</a> on Yemen’s Houthis in a message group that included his wife, brother and personal lawyer.</p>
<p>The revelations that Hegseth used the unclassified messaging system Signal for the <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1901536"">second time</a> to share highly sensitive security details come at a delicate moment for him, with senior officials ousted from the Pentagon last week as part of investigations into alleged leaks.</p>
<p>“The president stands strongly behind Secretary Hegseth, who is doing a phenomenal job leading the Pentagon,” Leavitt told <em>Fox News</em> host Brian Kilmeade. “And this is what happens when the entire Pentagon is working against you and working against the monumental change that you are trying to implement.”</p>
<p>In the second chat, Hegseth shared details of the attack similar to those <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1900541"">revealed</a> last month by <em>The Atlantic</em> magazine after its editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was included in a separate chat on the Signal app by mistake.</p>
<p>    <figure class=""media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven"">
        <div class=""media__item  media__item--newskitlink  "">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The second chat included about a dozen people and was created during Hegseth’s confirmation process to discuss administrative issues rather than detailed military planning. Among them was Hegseth’s brother, who is a Department of Homeland Security liaison to the Pentagon. Leavitt said Hegseth shared no classified information on either Signal chat.</p>
<p>The chat included details of the schedule of the air strikes, a source familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Hegseth’s wife, Jennifer, a former <em>Fox News</em> producer, has attended sensitive meetings with foreign military counterparts, according to images the Pentagon has publicly posted. During a meeting Hegseth had with his British counterpart at the Pentagon in March, his wife could be seen sitting behind him.</p>
<p>Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell, without evidence, said that the media was “enthusiastically taking the grievances of disgruntled former employees as the sole sources for their article.” “The Trump-hating media continues to be obsessed with destroying anyone committed to President Trump’s agenda. We’ve already achieved so much for the American warfighter, and will never back down,” Parnell said in a statement on X.</p>
<p>The latest revelation comes days after Dan Caldwell, one of Hegseth’s leading advisers, was escorted from the Pentagon after being identified during an investigation into leaks at the Department of Defence.</p>
<p>Following Caldwell’s departure, less-senior officials Darin Selnick, who recently became Hegseth’s deputy chief of staff, and Colin Carroll, who was chief of staff to Deputy Defence Secretary Steve Feinberg, were put on administrative leave and fired on Friday.</p>
<p>White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said that “recently fired leakers are continuing to misrepresent the truth to soothe their shattered egos and undermine the President’s agenda.</p>
<p><strong>Tumultuous moment for Hegseth</strong></p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers said Hegseth could no longer stay in his job. “We keep learning how Pete Hegseth put lives at risk,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a <a class=""link--external"" href=""https://x.com/SenSchumer/status/1914084912010870816"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">post</a> to X. “But Trump is still too weak to fire him. Pete Hegseth must be fired.”</p>

OIC to continue supporting Kashmiris’ right to self-determination: envoy,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 08:35:43 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>ISLAMABAD: Assistant Secretary General of OIC and Special Envoy for Jammu and Kashmir Ambassador Yousef Mohammad S. Aldobeay on Monday expressed full support for Kashmiris’ inherent right to <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1881080"">self-determination</a>.</p>
<p>Aldobeay, who was leading a delegation which met AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry here, said the OIC has condemned <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1887113"">brutalities</a> being perpetrated against the people of Indian-occupied Kashmir in the past and it will continue to raise voice for their internationally recognised right in the days ahead in an effective manner.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Barrister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry said that the OIC and its member countries should join forces and play their muchneeded role in helping resolve the longstanding Kashmir and <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1905598"">Palestine</a> issues.</p>
<p>He expressed these views during a meeting with the OIC delegation.</p>
<p>Referring to India’s relentless repression of political and human rights in Kashmir, he stressed the need for intensifying efforts to resolve the lingering Kashmir dispute peacefully in accordance with the UNSC resolutions.</p>
<p>He said that there was a dire need that the Muslim countries use their diplomatic, economic and political clout to stop the bloodbath of the Kashmiri and Palestinian people who have suffered more than 70 years under brutal foreign occupation.</p>
<p>Barrister Chaudhry commended the OIC’s steadfast support to Kashmiris’ just cause, stating that the Muslim body has always supported Kashmiris’ struggle.</p>
<p>Terming India and Israel two sides of the same coin, he said the fascist regimes have been engaged in systematic genocide of Palestinian and Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>India’s relentless repression of political and human rights in Kashmir, he said, involved killing and maiming Kashmiris through heavy militarisation, arbitrary arrests and detention of political activists.</p>
<p>Kashmir, he said, has been turned into an open air prison where people have been deprived of all their basic rights and essential freedoms.</p>

Religious parties  seek abolition of Bangladesh  women’s commission,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:30:23 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>DHAKA: Bangladesh’s influential coalition of the religious parties has demanded the abolition of a government women’s commission, a further indication of how hardline, religiously fuelled activism is strengthening after years of suppression.</p>
<p>The women’s commission is part of efforts to reform systems installed during the iron-fisted rule of Shiekh Hasina, who was <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1850270"">overthrown</a> by student-led mass protests in August 2024.</p>
<p>Hefazat-e-Islam, a platform of religious seminaries, wants the cancellation of the Women’s Affairs Reforms Commission, set up by the caretaker government of Nobel Peace prize winner Mohammed Yunus.</p>
<p>Azizul Haque Islamabadi, a senior Hefazat-e-Islam leader, said the group opposed the commission’s recommendation for ending discriminatory provisions against women.</p>
<p>“Ensuring equality is a Western ideology,” Islamabadi said. “The commission recommended a uniform family code instead of Muslim family law, which governs inheritance, marriage, divorce, and other issues.” Jamaat-i-Islami, the largest religious political party, also demanded the immediate cancellation of the recommendations.</p>
<p>“Recommending initiatives to ensure equality between men and women is a malicious effort to distort Islamic ideology,” Mia Golam Parwar, secretary general of Jamaat, said in a statement. Yunus said after the commission submitted its recommendations on April 19 that  “women all over the world are looking at us”.</p>
<p>Hasina’s government was blamed for extensive human rights abuses and she took a tough stand against religious movements during her 15-year rule.</p>
<p>She is in exile in India, refusing to return to Dhaka to face charges of crimes against humanity for the killing of hundreds of protesters during the unrest that toppled her government. Bangladesh has seen a surge of open support for religious groups since her ouster.</p>

12 killed in US air strikes on Yemen’s Sanaa,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:22:58 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>SANAA: Yemen’s Houthis said early on Monday that US air strikes on Sanaa killed at least 12 people and wounded 34, with a military spokesperson later claiming attacks on US aircraft carriers and Israel.</p>
<p>The Houthi-run <em>Saba</em> news agency cited the ministry as saying the dead and injured had come from overnight strikes  “by the American enemy” on a market and a residential zone in Sanaa’s Farwa district.</p>
<p>The rebels’ health ministry reported 12 dead and 34 wounded  “as a result of a raid by the US enemy” in Farwa. Other raids were reported late Sunday in the central province of Marib, Hodeida in the west and the Houthi bastion of Saada in the north, Saba said.</p>
<p>Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree said the group launched attacks on two US aircraft carriers in response to the latest deadly American strikes. The Houthis also targeted two Israeli locations with drones, he said.</p>
<p>The US military has been carrying out almost daily attacks for the past month, saying it was targeting the  “Iran-backed Houthi terrorists” to stop attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. One attack on Thursday on the Ras Issa oil port killed some 80 people and injured 150, according to the Houthis.</p>

Maulana joins hands with Jamaat-i-Islami for pro-Palestine agitation,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 09:41:19 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>LAHORE: The Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) on Monday urged all political parties to unite and adopt a firm and clear position on the Israeli barbarity being unleashed on <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1905598"">Gaza</a>, as they criticised the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) for its weak stance on the issue.</p>
<p>The remarks came after JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman visited the JI headquarters in Lahore on Monday to “discuss the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza and other pressing national issues”.</p>
<p>After the meeting, the heads of both parties held a press conference and expressed concern over the ongoing Israeli aggression in Gaza, the silence of Muslim world leaders, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s weak stance on the matter.</p>
<p>JI emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman stressed that political parties should openly denounce both the United States and Israel, reiterating that the JI would continue its dialogue and cooperation with other political and religious parties, including JUI-F, but its political struggle would remain independent and platform-specific. He also thanked Maulana Fazlur Rehman and his delegation for visiting Mansoora.</p>
<blockquote class=""blockquote-level-1"">
<p>Hafiz Naeem rejects 26th amendment, says it has weakened the judiciary</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He announced that the JI would hold a nationwide strike on April 26 in solidarity with the people of Gaza, as part of its ongoing public awareness campaign for Palestine.</p>
<p>Maulana Fazlur Rehman said the entire Muslim Ummah was deeply agitated over the situation in Gaza and called for a stronger and clearer position from the OIC. He also shared that the JUI-F had formed a joint platform, Majlis Ittehad-i-Ummat, for collective efforts in support of Gaza.</p>
<p>Speaking about the <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1866480"">26th Amendment</a>, the Maulana remarked that different political parties may have varying opinions, which should not be interpreted as major discord. He also stressed that provincial resources should primarily serve the people of the province.</p>

<p>Responding to journalists’ questions, the JI chief categorically rejected the 26th Constitutional Amendment, stating it had weakened the judiciary. He reiterated JI’s long-standing demand for a probe into electoral rigging and asserted that instead of holding new elections, the country needed a thorough investigation into the last polls for electoral transparency.</p>
<p>Naeemur Rehman noted that this was his first meeting with Maulana Fazlur Rehman since becoming party chief and that further engagement would continue in future. Both sides agreed on the importance of upholding constitutional supremacy and stressed that all institutions must operate within their constitutional boundaries.</p>

The Geneva-based institution had announced earlier this month that Schwab, 87, would be stepping down, without indicating a timeframe.</p>
<p>“Following my recent announcement, and as I enter my 88th year, I have decided to step down from the position of Chair and as a member of the Board of Trustees, with immediate effect,” Schwab said in a statement released by the WEF. The WEF board said in the statement that it had accepted Schwab’s resignation at an extraordinary meeting held on April 20, and that Vice Chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe would become the interim chairman. A committee to appoint a future chair has been established.</p>
<p>Schwab established the WEF in 1971 with the aim of creating a forum for policymakers and top corporate executives to tackle major global issues.</p>
<p>Widely regarded as a cheerleader for globalisation, the WEF’s annual Davos gathering has in recent years drawn disapproval from critics as elitist and removed from ordinary people.</p>

Work on $2bn motorway projects to start this year: minister,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 09:02:24 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan on Monday announced that construction of $2 billion <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1881038"">Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway</a> (M-6) and <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1867412"">Karachi-Hyderabad Motorway</a> (M-9) will start this year.</p>
<p>The federal minister announced this while chairing a meeting of the National Highway Authority (NHA).</p>
<p>The M-6 project, an integral part of <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1884628"">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a>, has already been delayed by six years.</p>
<p>In a recent meeting, a Senate panel had <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1903038"">ordered</a> the NHA to give top priority to much-awaited M-6 project.</p>

<p>On the occasion, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal had assured the committee members of implementing all decisions of the panel and agreed that the first priority would be given to M-6 project.</p>
<p>In a statement last month, Mr Iqbal had said that work on the much-delayed M-6 project, along with M-9, would start next year.</p>

Russia resumes attacks on Ukraine after Easter truce,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:14:20 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>KYIV: Russia launched a wave of aerial attacks at Ukraine on Monday in an abrupt end to a fragile <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1905294/russias-putin-declares-unilateral-easter-ceasefire-in-ukraine"">Easter truce</a>, while Vladimir Putin pushed back against the idea of a month-long halt to strikes on civilian targets, as proposed by Kyiv.</p>
<p>The renewed attacks, confirmed by both Moscow and Kyiv, cast doubt on Donald Trump’s hopes for a broader ceasefire between the two sides, hours after the US president said he hoped a “deal” could be struck this week.</p>
<p>“Military action has resumed,” Putin told state TV reporters on Monday, after Ukrainian officials reported a wave of overnight drone and artillery strikes following the partially-observed 30-hour truce.</p>
<p>Each side had in any case accused the other of thousands of violations of the ceasefire, which Putin ordered in a surprise announcement on Saturday. “But overall, there was a fall in such activity,” Putin said, after listing alleged Ukrainian violations.</p>
<blockquote class=""blockquote-level-1"">
<p>Kyiv’s delegation to visit London for peace talks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“We welcome this and are ready to look to the future.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had welcomed the ceasefire and said his military would respond “symmetrically” to whatever Russia’s forces did on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Kyiv officials have accused Putin of seeking a cheap reputational victory by proposing the truce — which came hours after Trump threatened to walk away from efforts to secure peace in the three-year war if he did not see progress. The US president expressed hopes the two sides could strike an agreement in the coming days, though he did not elaborate on what he had in mind.</p>
<p>“Hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week,” he said on his Truth Social platform. Asked about Trump’s remarks on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow “hopes” US efforts “will yield results”.</p>
<p>Welcoming a day without air raid alerts across the country, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky proposed “to cease any strikes using long-range drones and missiles on civilian infrastructure for a period of at least 30 days.” Putin said Russia would “analyse” the idea, but questioned how it would work as he accused Ukraine of using civilian buildings for military purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Ceasefire talks in London</strong></p>
<p>A Ukrainian delegation will be in London on Wednesday for ceasefire talks, as European and US officials press for a halt to Russia’s invasion, Zelensky said. The talks will be a follow-up to a meeting in Paris last week, in which US Secretary of State Marco Rubio presented Washington’s plan for ending the three-year war.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump has been pushing all sides to accept a ceasefire, but has failed to extract any major concessions from the Kremlin despite repeated negotiations and a brief truce announced by Russia’s Vladimir Putin over Easter.</p>
<p>“Already this Wednesday, our representatives will be working in London. Ukraine, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States — we are ready to move forward as constructively as possible,” Zelensky said on X on Monday.</p>
<p>“An unconditional ceasefire must be the first step toward peace,” he added. Zelensky did not say who else would attend, but Rubio suggested earlier that a US delegation would take part.</p>
