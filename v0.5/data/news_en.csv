Coalition partners put canals on the negotiating table,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 09:09:04 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>â¢ Second contact between PPP, PML-N leaders in as many days hints at âsoftening of stancesâ<br />
â¢ Rana Sana says water distribution issue to be resolved on administrative, technical grounds<br />
â¢ Azma criticises Bilawal for âharsh remarksâ; Ghani accuses PML-N of trying to hurt PPP</p>
<p>KARACHI: As both coalition partners began seeing eye to eye on the <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1892222"">issue of canals</a>, the acrimony caused by the controversial canals on the Indus River continues to rile up their middle-tier leaders, highlighting the extent to which the issue has driven a wedge between them.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1902095/bilawal-says-ppp-will-not-support-govts-unilateral-canal-project"">initial anger</a>, however, seems to have subsided, with both sides agreeing to a dialogue, and two phone calls between the senior leaders of the PPP and the PML-N in as many days showing that both sides have softened their stances, which may pave the way for a consensus.</p>
<p>On Monday, Prime Ministerâs adviser Rana Sanaullah and Sindhâs senior minister Sharjeel Memon held a second consecutive telephonic conversation in as many days. Both leaders once again signalled a thaw in frosty ties, reaffirming their commitment to resolving the issue through dialogue.</p>
<p>Later, talking to a private news channel in the evening, Rana Sanaullah said PM Shehbaz Sharifâs government believed in resolving all matters through mutual understanding, and that it was not possible for any province to be deprived of its rightful share.</p>
<p>    <figure class=""media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven"">
        <div class=""media__item  media__item--newskitlink  "">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>âUnder the [1991] Water Accord, no prÂ­oÂ­vÂ­inceâs water can be diverted to anÂ­other, nor is it being done,â he said. âThe distribution of water is an administrative and technical issue, and it will be resolved on administrative and technical grounds. Let me be very clear that no province will be deprived of its rights, provincial concerns will be addressed, and the process of consultation will be further expanded.â</p>
<p>Although the Sindh government did not come up with an immediate reaction to the latest response from Islamabad, InforÂ­maÂ­tion Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon issÂ­ued a statement urging mainly nationalist parties â currently staging sit-ins acrÂ­oss the province and blocking roads and highways in protest against the canal project â to ensure that their demonstrations do not cause inconvenience to the public.</p>
<p>âThe political parties have a constitutional right to peaceful protest on the issue of the canal,â the statement quoted Mr Memon as saying. âDemonstrations, rallies, processions â whatever form a party chooses to protest in â they should inform the government and hold their protests in open spaces or areas where the public does not face inconvenience. The protest and dissent are the essence of every democracy, but the protest should not cause trouble for the public.â</p>
<p>However, the Sindh minister is scheduled to hold a press conference today, in which he is expected to address the canals issue.</p>
<p><strong>Unabated criticism</strong></p>
<p>Despite all the headway, unless the engagement between the two sides translates into a tangible outcome, the exchange of criticism from both ends is likely to continue unabated. It was Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari who first took a potshot at PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, criticising him for his âharshâ remarks.</p>
<p>The minister said if Punjab did not purchase wheat under its policy, it didnât leave the farmers helpless either. Punjabâs farmers will be given a Rs100 billion package, Rs5,000 per acre, and a Rs25 billion wheat programme. Punjabâs farmers have been given Kisan Cards, thousands of tractors, and super seeders.</p>
<p>âIt is unfortunate that no one has spoken about the condition of Sindhâs farmers. Neither was a wheat price fixed nor were Kisan Cards issued. In contrast, the Punjab government has taken multiple steps for the welfare of farmers.â</p>
<p><strong>âNo compromiseâ</strong></p>
<p>Hours later, senior PPP leader and Sindh minister Saeed Ghani strongly criticised the PML-N, accusing it of âdeliberately attemptingâ to weaken his party over the controversial canal project. Speaking to the media in Karachi, Mr Ghani made it clear that the PPP would not compromise on the construction of new canals.</p>
<p>    <figure class=""media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven"">
        <div class=""media__item  media__item--newskitlink  "">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>âIt seems PML-N wants to harm the PPP. They must remove any notion from their minds that we will accept the canal projects through negotiations. We categorically reject them,â he said.</p>
<p>According to Mr Ghani, President Asif Ali Zardari holds no executive power under the Constitution, and in Pakistanâs parliamentary system, such powers lie with the prime minister. However, even the PM does not have the authority to decide water distribution, he added.</p>
<p>âPresident Zardari publicly opposed the canal projects in the joint session of parliament. Opposition parties are beating drums over something no one actually heard,â he said while responding to criticism about President Zardariâs alleged support for the project in a âclosed-door meetingâ.</p>

X rival Bluesky adds blue checks for trusted accounts,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:57:07 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>X <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1872925"">rival</a> Bluesky on Monday said it was adding blue checks to accounts that have been verified to confirm users are who they claim to be.</p>
<p>In a blog post, the company said it would âproactively verify authentic and notable accounts and display a blue check next to their namesâ.</p>
<p>âTrust is everything,â the team said in the post.</p>
<p>The move mirrors a feature once deployed at Twitter in an effort to thwart imposters and help users know when account holders were authentic.</p>

<p>Billionaire Elon Musk <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1749015"">did away</a> with verifying who was behind accounts after he bought Twitter, now called X, in 2022.</p>
<p>Instead, Musk offered blue check marks to those paying for subscriptions for an X Premium tier on the social network.</p>
<p>âSocial media has connected us in powerful ways, but it hasnât always given us the tools to know who weâre interacting with or why we should trust them,â the Bluesky team said in its post.</p>
<p>Bluesky was created by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey as a side project in 2019.</p>
<p>Dorsey pulled five engineers aside to build a decentralised alternative to Twitter.</p>
<p>He said at the time that centralised attempts to police abuse and misinformation on a platform like Twitter were unlikely to work, and that he wanted to give users more control of personal data and content moderation.</p>
<p>Bluesky did not see the light of day until 2023, the year after Twitter was bought by Musk â a key ally of US President Donald Trump who has pushed misinformation on his platform since his takeover.</p>
<p>Bluesky said in a post early this year that it had grown to more than 30 million users.</p>
<p>The burgeoning social media network already lets individuals and organisations verify who they are by letting them use their website addresses as their user names, and more than 270,000 accounts use that option, according to the platform.</p>
<p>Bluesky is starting out such âtrusted verifiersâ with blue checks and plans to eventually launch a request form for accounts seeking the mark of authenticity, the team said.</p>
<p>Blueskyâs chief operating officer Rose Wang said in a recent interview with <em>AFP</em> that she was optimistic about the social networkâs trajectory.</p>
<p>âWe really see this as our coming-out year,â she said.</p>
<p>âPeople want to know whatâs happening in the world and need a safe, moderated space to discuss it, have fun, and make friends. Right now, theyâre not finding that anywhere else. â</p>",https://www.dawn.com/news/1905873/x-rival-bluesky-adds-blue-checks-for-trusted-accounts,en
Pakistan receives $12.5bn in foreign loans,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 09:55:44 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan authorities have materialised only $12.5 billion in foreign loans in the first nine months of 2024-25 against an annual $19.2bn target by June 30.</p>
<p>While half of this portfolio was legacy <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1850574"">rollovers</a> from China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates â fresh loans and grant inflows amounted to $5.51bn in nine months, almost 20pc lower than the comparable period of last fiscal year.</p>
<p>In its monthly report on Foreign Economic Assistance (FEA) released on Monday, the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) said that against its annual target of $19.4bn, total FEA in July-March amounted to $5.51bn compared to $6.9bn in the same period last year with the annual target of $17.6bn.</p>
<p>This does not include about $1bn disbursed by the IMF in October as upfront payment under the $7bn ongoing Extended Fund Facility (EFF) that is accounted for separately by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). However, $1.2bn received a year back under the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) had also seen similar accounting treatment.</p>
<blockquote class=""blockquote-level-1"">
<p>Expected inflow of $9bn from Saudi Arabia and China critical to meet external funding gap in FY25</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With three rollovers and fresh disbursements, the total external assistance in nine months amounted to $12.46bn. This included $3bn rollovers by Saudi Arabia, $2bn by UAE and $1bn by China. This does not include another $2bn China rolled over last month, making its total rollover to $3bn thus far. Pakistan has a total annual rollover portfolio of about $12.7bn in safe deposits and loans from these three countries, leaving the countryâs net international reserves (NIR) at a deficit.</p>
<p>The foreign economic assistance recorded by the EAD showed inflows fell by about 20.2pc to about $5.5bn in July-March, apparently because of delayed IMF bailout and subsequent $1bn disbursements. Last year, these inflows amounted to $7.9bn in these nine months, including IMF.</p>
<p>In March this year, the EAD reported monthly inflows at $555 million, compared to $365m in February and $830m in January.</p>
<p>The EAD said that out of $5.5b, about $3bn was received for budgetary support or programme loans and the remaining $2.4bn for project financing. During the same period last year, EAD secured about $2.2bn as project aid and $4.7bn as programme loans.</p>
<p>Of the total, inflows from multilaterals stood at $2.83bn in 9MFY25 compared to $2.7bn last year, while bilateral disbursements stood at $358.5m against $870m last year.</p>
<p>The EAD reported to have received about $504m in loans from foreign commercial lenders (UAE-based) in nine months of the current year, showing a minor recovery from commercial banks who had stayed away from financing Pakistan last year. It may be noted that the government has budgeted $3.8bn in financing from foreign commercial banks for the current year, showing a poor start, again due to the delayed IMF umbrella.</p>
<p>The government has also targeted $1bn in international bonds for the current year. A projection for $9bn inflow from China and Saudi Arabia was targeted for FY25. These projections include a $5bn time deposit from Saudi Arabia and $4bn Chinaâs SAFE deposit. These projections are critical for Pakistan to meet its external financing gap as part of the IMF programme.</p>
<p>In addition, Pakistan also received $1.455bn from overseas Pakistanis through Naya Pakistan Certificates compared to $781m in the same period last year.</p>
<p>The Asian Development Bank disbursed $1.189bn in 9MFY25 compared to $665m a year ago, and $979m was received from the World Bank.</p>

âHeld ex-PAF officer was convicted of mutinyâ,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:15:52 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>ISLAMABAD: A retired air marshal, who was arrested last year, has been convicted on a number of charges, including mutiny, and is being detained at a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) mess, a PAF representative informed the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday.</p>
<p>Retired <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1417817#:~:text=Air%20Vice%20Marshal%20Javad%20Saeed"">Air Marshal Javad Saeed</a> was arrested in January 2024, after which his spouse filed a habeas corpus petition for his recovery.</p>
<p>At the time, IHC Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro dismissed the petition and imposed a fine of Rs25,000 on the petitioner as PAF authorities disclosed that Saeed was court-martialled and convicted under the Official Secrets Act.</p>
<p>    <figure class=""media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven"">
        <div class=""media__item  media__item--newskitlink  "">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The judge remarked that since Saeedâs whereabouts were already known, a habeas corpus petition could not be filed for his recovery.</p>
<p>Then, last month, Saeedâs spouse filed a review application against the dismissal and sought his release from PAFâs custody.</p>
<p>The petition stated that after the arrest, Saeedâs pension was stopped, and the government-provided family health services were also discontinued. But later, his wifeâs medical treatment was restored.</p>
<p><strong>The hearing</strong></p>
<p>During the hearing of the review application on Monday, a PAF official told the court that Saeed was detained under the Official Secrets Act.</p>
<p>After a court-martial by a PAF tribunal, he was sentenced to 14 yearsâ imprisonment. The air chief has reduced the sentence by 10 years and Saeed was serving the remaining four-year term.</p>
<p>The PAF official informed IHC that Saeed was detaiÂ­ned at an Officersâ Mess instead of a prison, where army officers serve their sentences after conviction as per law.</p>
<p>The petitionerâs counsel, retired Col Inamur Rahim, argÂ­ued that Saeed was being kept in illegal custody by PAF. He said that as a constitutional court, the IHC was duty-bound to set aside the âunlawful confinementâ.</p>
<p>He pointed out that following the conviction, convicts were sent to jail to complete the sentence. However, the PAF kept Saeed in its own custody.</p>
<p>Advocate Rahim said that Saeed was among the contenders for the post of air chief in 2021, but retired from service on March 18, 2021, after he was not promoted as air chief. The officer was taken into custody on January 1, 2024, the lawyer added.</p>
<p>Being a civilian, he could not be tried by the PAF Tribunal, he argued, adding that despite his conviction, Saeed was not handed over to jail authorities.</p>
<p>The PAF official informed the judge that the air chief had declared the Officerâs Mess as sub-jail. Therefore, Saeed was detained there in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Mr Rahim contested the assertion, saying such confinement was illegal.</p>
<p>He also said that authorities did not share details of the court-martial proceedings, leaving the convict unable to file an appeal in court.</p>
<p>The judge then directed PAF to share relevant details with the counsel and adjourned the hearing till April 29.</p>

<p>The training was <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1826426"">organised</a> under a project titled âintroduction and promotion of saffron in potential districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwaâ.</p>
<p>Farmers from various parts of Swat participated in the workshop.</p>
<p>Adnan Ahmad, research officer at ARI and focal person for the saffron project, said that the initiative was part of a wider effort to introduce saffron in suitable agro-climatic zones of the province.</p>
<p>âUnder the project, three training sessions are being held across KP. One was conducted in Mansehra, the second has just concluded here in Swat, and the third will be organised in Karak,â he said.</p>
<p>Mr Ahmad said that saffron cultivation required specific environmental conditions such as dry temperate climates with minimal monsoon rainfall. âWe are <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1800490"">training farmers</a> to understand what saffron is and how it can be cultivated in particular ecological settings. Although Swat has a comparatively moist climate, we plan to conduct trial cultivation in lower Swat and Kalam to evaluate its feasibility and explore necessary adaptations in production techniques,â he added.</p>
<p>Zakriya Bacha, research officer at ARI, said that the training was well-received by local farms. âFarmers from across the district attended it with enthusiasm. Since saffron is a relatively new crop for this region, both farmers and researchers are keen to explore its potential. We will begin cultivation on an experimental basis and closely monitor the results,â he added.</p>

    </figure></p>
<p>The farmers, who attended the training, expressed optimism about the initiative. They acknowledged saffronâs profitability and global demand and showed willingness to adopt the new crop if the trials proved successful.</p>
<p>The introduction of saffron in Swat aligns with the provincial governmentâs broader goal of promoting high-value crops to boost rural economy, enhance livelihoods and reduce reliance on traditional, low-profit agriculture.</p>

"Focus on recovery, reforms as Aurangzeb meets IMF, World Bank heads","Tue, 22 Apr 2025 07:47:48 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>WASHINGTON: Finance MiniÂ­ster Muhammad Aurangzeb met the heads of the IMF and World Bank on Monday to kick off a series of high-level consultations in Washington.</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb is in the US capital to <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1905259/aurangzeb-leaves-for-us-to-attend-imf-world-bank-meetings"">attend</a> the <a class=""link--external"" href=""https://meetings.imf.org/en/2025/Spring"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">2025 Spring Meetings</a> of the IMF and the World Bank Group, which brought together finance ministers and central bank governors from 191 countries to address global challenges such as sovereign debt, climate finance and reforming the international financial system.</p>
<p>The delegation, led by the finance minister, is scheduled to meet officials of global financial institutions, development partners, and major bilateral creditors.</p>
<p>Discussions with the IMF and World Bank chiefs focused on Pakistanâs economic recovery plan, structural reforms, and the future of ongoing programmes.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources told <em>Dawn</em> that the talks were âconstructiveâ.</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzebâs meeting with the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, was expected to positively influence the creditorâs review of Pakistanâs <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1860850"">$7 billion</a> Extended Fund Facility.</p>
<p>Pakistan is seeking the release of a <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1897968"">second tranche</a> of $1 billion. An IMF review mission is due in Pakistan on May 14.</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb also met the World Bank president, Ajay Banga, to discuss development financing and Pakistanâs medium-term reform priorities, including fiscal consolidation and energy sector reforms.</p>
<p>The minister has had half a dozen meetings since arriving in Washington on Sunday.</p>
<p>Some key engagements scheduled over the coming days include talks with Chinese, US, Saudi Arabia, UAE and European officials, as well as with commercial banks, global credit rating agencies, and multilateral lenders such as the Asian Development Bank.</p>

<p>A meeting with Chinese Finance Minister Lan Foâan later this week will focus on Pakistanâs request to reschedule the debt of $3.4bn â an effort to ease pressure on the countryâs foreign financing needs.</p>
<p>Mr Aurangzeb is also expected to meet senior US Treasury officials, including Robert Kaproth, the assistant secretary for International Finance, and James C. Cruse, the acting president of the US Exim Bank.</p>
<p>A central item on the agenda will be the $3bn financing gap for the Reko Diq copper and gold project.</p>
<p>The Exim Bank has expressed interest in offering $1bn in loan, contingent on receiving preferential creditor status â a condition that Pakistan has not yet agreed to.</p>
<p>The finance minister is also scheduled to engage with Mohamed Nasheed, the secretary general of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, for discussions on climate finance and disaster resilience.</p>
<p>On Monday, Mr Aurangzeb also met the representatives of Deloitte, one of the Big Four accounting firms, and briefed them on Pakistanâs macroeconomic outlook, development priorities, and export-led growth agenda.</p>
<p>The discussions included energy reforms, the extraction and marketing of critical minerals, privatisation, technology and crypto regulation, and the operationalisation of the Country Partnership FramÂ­ework.</p>
<p>The minister welcomed Deloitteâs planned visit to Pakistan in May 2025.</p>
<p>Officials in Washington have said that Pakistanâs objective during the talks was not only to secure funding but also strengthen long-term partnerships that support sustainable economic reforms.</p>

PTI-JUI gulf widens despite overtures,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 07:55:23 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>â¢ Ayub says party canât force Maulana to join âgrand allianceâ<br />
â¢ Fazl willing to engage with PTI, party seeks clarity on Imranâs âgreen-light for talksâ</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD: The gulf between reluctant allies â the PTI and JUI-F â has widened to the point that leaders from Imran Khanâs party seem to have lost hope of launching a much-touted <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1891429"">joint struggle</a> alongside the religio-political outfit led by Maulana Fazlur Rehman.</p>
<p>This was evidenced by Opposition Leader Omar Ayubâs recent admission that they would forge ahead with their agitation, as they could not force the Maulana to join their âgrand allianceâ.</p>
<p>âWe will take our caravan and move forward. Whoever comes in the caravan is fine, we will not force Maulana Sahib to support us,â he said during an appearance on <em>DawnNewsTV</em> on Monday.</p>
<p>He said the Maulana had his own political party, and if he did not want to join hands with the PTI, then it was his decision to make.</p>
<p>The PTI had earlier been quite confident that it would be able to win over the veteran politician from Dera Ismail Khan with help from their allies in the Tehreek Tahaffuz Aayen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) alliance.</p>
<p>However, the recent brouhaha over whether the incarcerated PTI founder was willing to cut a deal with the establishment for his release seems to have driven a wedge between the two parties.</p>
<p>Recently, PTI leader Azam Swati  â whose previous allegiances include the JUI-F  â <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1902573"">claimed</a> he had Imran Khanâs blessing to approach the establishment for talks. However, while this impression was refuted by other party leaders such as Salman Akram Raja and Omar Ayub, the JUI-F took exception and sought clarity from the PTI.</p>
<p>    <figure class=""media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven"">
        <div class=""media__item  media__item--newskitlink  "">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>For his part, the Maulanaâs recent remarks have indicated a cooling of tensions with PTI. During his press talk alongside the Jamaat-i-Islami chief in Mansoora on Monday, he expressed a willingness to âmend relations with the PTI to an extent where political dialogue is possible and national issues discussedâ.</p>
<p>The veteran politician said that while they also had political differences with the PPP and PML-N, this should not be construed as a personal enmity.</p>
<p>âIn the same spirit, we also want our relations with the PTI to be cordial enough to carry on political dialogue,â the Maulana said.</p>
<p>But according to JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza, the party wants a definitive answer on whether the PTI seeks to launch an anti-government drive, or cosy up with the powers that be. In an earlier appearance on <em>DawnNewsTV</em>, Senator Murtaza had indicated that the JUI-F chief was ready to disengage with the PTI over this.</p>
<p>âThe JUI-F might not join the opposition alliance if the PTI has decided to engage with the establishment,â he had said.</p>
<p>âIf an alliance between the two parties is formed, then all decisions will need to be taken in light of party discipline,â Senator Murtaza claimed, adding that decisions would be taken through consensus in such a case.</p>
<p>On Monday, Mr Ayub again denied the impression that his party was pursing the establishment, saying that no dialogue was taking place, nor were any attempts being made to initiate such talks.</p>
<p>However, he maintained that all parties that were part of the TTAP alliance â led by PkMAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai â would be taken on board in case such a move was on the cards.</p>
<p>Mr Ayub refused to answer when asked, point blank, whom these talks would be held with.</p>

"HBL PSL 2025: Khushdil, Warner help Karachi Kings edge Peshawar Zalmi in thriller","Tue, 22 Apr 2025 11:11:16 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>KARACHI: Under the blazing lights of the National Bank Stadium, an electric crowd â the largest so far in this <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1905504/hbl-psl-2025-islamabad-united-continue-unbeaten-run-as-karachi-kings-falter"">HBL Pakistan Super League season</a> â erupted as Khushdil Shah clinched a heart-stopping two-wicket victory for Karachi Kings against Peshawar Zalmi here on Monday night.</p>
<p>With Kings reeling at 133-8, needing 15 off 12, Khushdilâs (23 not out off 17, three fours) nerveless assault on a tricky, low-bounce pitch turned the tide, providing them with the finishing touch after skipper David Warnerâs gritty maiden PSL fifty (60 off 47, eight fours) and a spirited Zalmi fightback led by Luke Wood (3-28).</p>
<p>Entering the match with Kings at two wins from four and Zalmi at one from three, this triumph, in the final game in the metropolis this season, bolstered Kingsâ playoff hopes.</p>

<p>The chase was a rollercoaster, defined by Khushdilâs late heroics and a tense climax. Warner, the seasonâs biggest signing of the league, set the tone, as the southpaw battled seam and low bounce with deft drives and ramps, notably against Ali Raza (2-32), whom he plundered for three fours in the 14th over, including a ramp to fine leg and a slash past point.</p>
<p>His fifty, reached with a slice to deep point off Arif Yaqoob (1-18), steadied Kings at 107-5 before Woodâs back-of-the-hand slower ball, however, clean-bowled Warner in the 17th over, sparking Zalmiâs wild celebrations as Kings needed 29 off 21. Abbas Afridi and Aamer Jamal fell quickly, leaving Khushdil to face the pressure at 133-8.</p>
<p>In scintillating form this season, Khushdil rose to the occasion. Against Ali, he played cautiously, nurdling singles to keep the chase alive, but unleashed his power against Hussain Talat in the final over, as they required nine to win.</p>
<p>A hammered four past backward point off a short, wide ball set the tone, and after a single, Hasan Aliâs (six not out off three) exquisite pull for another boundary sealed the win for Karachi, sparking delirium among the raucous crowd, whose energy outshone the legâs earlier matches.</p>
<p>Earlier, Tim Seifert fell on the very first ball to Wood, James Vince (11 off nine, two fours) nicked off, and Saad Baig was bowled by Ali. Mohammad Nabi (14 off 11, a four and a six) and Irfan Khan (10 off 16) kept Kingsâ hopes alive but Arifâs spin and a run-out tightened the screws, making Khushdilâs composure pivotal.</p>
<p>Earlier after being put into bat, Zalmi posted a fighting 147-8, setting the stage for a tense chase on a bowler-friendly pitch.</p>
<p>The Zalmi innings, marked by disciplined bowling from Kings and flashes of resilience from Babar Azam and Alzarri Joseph, unfolded as a tale of survival and sporadic defiance.</p>
<p>Kings unleashed their pace battery with Mir Hamza (1-14) setting the tone. His opening spell was a masterclass, exploiting early swing and seam to keep Zalmi openers, Babar and Saim Ayub, on a leash.</p>
<p>Hamzaâs probing lines accounted for Saim, who fell to a rash shot, caught by Vince at backward point. Babar, surviving an early lbw scare via review, battled through a testing powerplay, managing 19 off 25 by the sixth over, but the pitchâs behaviour stifled fluency.</p>
<p>The middle overs saw Zalmi wrestle for momentum. Tom Kohler-Cadmoreâs brief stay at the crease ended with a stunning catch by Irfan off Khushdil (3-20), whose crafty spin dismantled Zalmiâs core.</p>
<p>Babar, anchoring the innings, found rhythm with elegant drives, amassing 46 off 41, including seven fours. Yet, his attempt to accelerate was thwarted by Khushdilâs quicker delivery, trapping him lbw in the 10th over â a crucial blow.</p>
<p>Mohammad Haris (28 off 21) injected impetus with audacious strokeplay but Abbasâ (3-30) cunning slower ball sent him packing, caught by Warner.</p>
<p>Kingsâ bowlers maintained relentless pressure. Abbas excelled at the death, dismissing Hussain (18 off 16) and Wood, while Khushdilâs guile removed Mitchell Owen.</p>
<p>With Zalmi reeling at 111-5 after 16 overs, Alzarri Josephâs late flourish (24 not out off 13, two fours and a six) provided a lifeline. His muscular hits, alongside a few wayward deliveries from Hasan, pushed Zalmi close to 150 â a total that, given the pitchâs challenges, proved just short.</p>

Rawalpindi health workersâ protest against hospitals outsourcing mars anti-polio campaign,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 11:22:17 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>RAWALPINDI: As the district launched its <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1905470"">week-long polio vaccination</a> drive on Monday, health workers in at least three tehsils â Kahuta, Kallar Syedan, and Gujar Khan â refused to participate in the campaign to protest the decision to outsource public-sector hospitals.</p>
<p>According to Young Doctors Associationâs office-bearer Dr Aarif Aziz, the notification for the outsourcing of the Jinnah Hospital Lahore had been issued while there was a plan to outsource different departments of Mayo Hospital Lahore.</p>
<p>The staff of the basic health units and tehsil headquarters hospitals in these tehsils boycotted the anti-polio drive and staged protests in their respective areas. They demanded that the government withdraw the plan to outsource hospitals and basic health units in the tehsils. They also expressed solidarity with the Young Doctors Association for their protest against the outsourcing of hospitals.</p>
<p>In Rawalpindi city, the sanitary patrol and school nutrition supervisors also expressed their resentment against the decision and warned they would not become part of the polio as well as dengue campaigns in protest.</p>
<blockquote class=""blockquote-level-1"">
<p>Health workers in Kahuta, Gujar Khan, Kallar Syedan tehsils in Pindi district boycott drive, urge govt to withdraw plan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the boycott, the campaign was suspended in some parts of the district, prompting the administration to approach the Punjab government for help.</p>
<p>District Health Authority Chief Executive Officer Dr Asif Arbab Niazi said they had already made arrangements to run the drive in the affected tehsils. He acknowledged there was a shortage of 2,500 workers in these tehsils in light of the protest.</p>
<p>In order to fill this gap, the health authority has sought 1,500 officials from the education department, 1,200 from the nursing college, and 300 from the revenue department, he said, adding that a total of 3,000 people would be at the disposal of the health authority to run the campaign.</p>
<p>He said that the stationary teams at railway stations, the airport, and bus stations were working as per their plan, adding that there was no issue in the city areas and the district authority had sought the help of the local political leadership to supervise the campaign. He said that the district administration had asked all the departments to help the authority make the campaign successful.</p>
<p><em>APP</em> adds: The Islamabad administration also launched its campaign aiming to vaccinate 461,125 children aged up to five years.</p>
<p>According to the state-run agency, the campaign will run for seven days, during which health workers will go door-to-door to administer oral polio drops to children.</p>
<p>Officials said that during the campaign, more than 461,000 children across Islamabad will be given the polio vaccine, with a special focus on urban slums, border areas with Rawalpindi, and locations with high population mobility.</p>
<p>It said polio teams from Islamabad and Rawalpindi will work jointly in the border areas to prevent any missed cases, especially in the transit and high-risk zones.</p>
<p>The vaccination teams will also be present at major bus terminals and other public spaces, and camps will be set up at points where families and children frequently travel, ensuring that those on the move are not left out of the drive.</p>
<p>On the occasion, Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon directed that all vaccination teams must be provided full security. Police and other law enforcement personnel have been tasked to escort the teams and ensure their safety, especially in sensitive areas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Islamabad administration asked community leaders and school officials to play their part in spreading awareness and encouraging participation. Authorities said that awareness efforts are key to countering misinformation and building trust in the vaccine.</p>
<p>In the coming days, district officials will monitor the progress of the campaign through regular field visits. Mobile teams will also be deployed to cover remote and underserved areas. These teams will move from one locality to another to make sure every child is vaccinated, regardless of where they live. According to health officials, the children who miss the vaccine this week will be identified and followed up on in the next round. A reporting and feedback system has been set up to track such cases and ensure they are not left behind.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a man was killed and two others suffered serious injuries in a clash over an enmity between two rival groups at Mehtab Chowk in Hasilpur.</p>

<p>The deceased was identified as Idrees while the injured were Muhammad Sharif and Rehmat.</p>

<p><strong>ENCOUNTER:</strong> A robber involved in over 50 cases of crime was killed while a constable suffered injuries in an encounter near Khairpur Tamewali.</p>

<p>According to police, the robber, Ghulam Mustafa, and his two accomplices allegedly snatched a motorcycle from one Rizwan who along with his two friends was standing by the roadside and fled. When police were informed on 15, a team rushed to the scene and cordoned off the area.</p>

<p>During the exchange of fire, one of the robbers was killed while Constable Muhammad Amin suffered serious injuries. When the firing stopped, Ghulam Mustafa, a resident of Inayati, was found dead.</p>

<p>The police claimed that he was killed by the firing of his accomplices. His body as well as Constable Amin were shifted to THQ Hospital Khairpur Tamewali.</p>

<p>A case was registered against the deceased suspectâs two accomplices.</p>

<p><strong>HOSPITAL WITHOUT POWER:</strong> The Multan Electric Power Company (Mepco) disconnected power connection to the THQ Mailsi over the default of Rs10m dues.</p>

<p>With the severing of electricity connection, the patients suffered in hot weather conditions, urging the authorities concerned to restore the power connection after payment of arrears.</p>

<p>THQ Hospital Medical Superintendent Rana Mazhar Iqbal was quoted as saying that the hospitalâs budget was awaited and as soon as the amount would be received, the defaulting amount would be paid to Mepco.</p>

<p><strong>SEMINAR:</strong> A number of students and teachers at a seminar at Islamia University Bahawalpur (IUB) paid homage to Allama Iqbal.</p>

<p>The speakers spoke on his poetry and philosophy, urging the students to follow his teachings.</p>

<p>âA kind of coalition is formingâ¦ to undermine and disrupt the diplomatic process,â Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei told reporters, saying Israel was behind the effort.</p>
<p>âAlongside it are a series of warmongering currents in the United States and figures from different factions,â the spokesman added.</p>
<p><em>The New York Times</em> reported on Thursday that US President Donald Trump had dissuaded Israel from striking Iranâs nuclear sites in the short term.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Israel would never allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Western powers and Israel, considered by experts the only nuclear-armed state in the Middle East, have long accused Tehran of seeking nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Iran has always denied the charge, insisting its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes only.</p>
<p>In 2018, Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a landmark nuclear deal signed three years earlier that eased sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.  A year later, Iran began to gradually breach the terms of the deal, most notably by enriching uranium to high levels.</p>
<p>According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Tehran has enriched uranium to 60 per cent, close to the 90pc level needed to manufacture weapons, and continues to accumulate large stocks of fissile material.</p>
<p>The 2015 nuclear deal restricted it to 3.67 percent.</p>
<p>Iran and the United States, arch-foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, are set to meet for a third round of talks mediated by Oman.</p>

H2(N)O: Nor any drop to drink for Karachiâs other half,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:59:55 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>At the crack of dawn, around 6am, Amina is already in line with two buckets. Sheâll wait nearly an hour for water â if it comes. If not, sheâll walk 15 minutes to a neighbour who sells it by the jerrycan. She does this every day before making breakfast for her family.</p>
<p>During the day, when her five-year-old needs to use the toilet, sheâll walk him to the end of the lane where a few families share a makeshift bathroom. It has no door, no water, and no drainage. In her neighbourhood, like many of Karachiâs informal settlements, clean water and safe sanitation access is a daily struggle.</p>
<p>Aminaâs story isnât unique. It reflects the everyday reality of millions of people in Karachiâs <em>katchi abadis</em> (informal settlements) that house nearly half the cityâs population. These communities are often lumped together, treated as a single, uniform category in policy discussions, as if every <em>katchi abadi</em> faces the same conditions and challenges. But in truth, they vary widely in how much access they have to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services.</p>
<p>Our recent <a class=""link--external"" href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4505/adb453"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">study</a> of five informal settlements across Karachi reveals just how stark these differences can be. If Karachi is serious about addressing its water and sanitation crisis, the solution does not lie in billion-rupee mega-projects. Real change must begin in the cityâs most underserved communities, where even modest investments can dramatically improve daily life for millions.

<h2><a class=""heading-permalink"" href=""#a-tale-of-two-settlements"" id=""a-tale-of-two-settlements"" title=""Permalink""></a>A tale of two settlements</h2>
<p>Consider the contrast between Manzoor Colony and Ilyas Goth.</p>
<p>Manzoor Colony, a settlement regularised in the early 1990s with <a class=""link--external"" href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956247806069626"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">support from the Orangi Pilot Project</a>, has basic but functioning infrastructure. Nearly every household has piped water, flush toilets, and overhead storage tanks. As a result, residents report fewer waterborne illnesses compared to other settlements.</p>
<p>Ilyas Goth, by contrast, is a small settlement located next to an open sewer. No household has piped water or a private toilet. Residents collect water from neighbours or a nearby <em>dhaba</em>, using only around 13 litres per person per day. This is not just below international benchmarks; it is lower than usage in other water-scarce areas of Karachi and falls beneath the World Health Organisationâs (WHO) <a class=""link--external"" href=""https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/water-sanitation-and-health/environmental-health-in-emergencies/humanitarian-emergencies"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">emergency minimum of 15 litres per person per day</a> used in disaster zones. Sanitation access is equally dire. Only one public toilet exists in the entire community, reserved for women and costing Rs20 per use. Unsurprisingly, three out of four households in Ilyas Goth reported a waterborne illness in the past two months.</p>
<h2><a class=""heading-permalink"" href=""#does-legal-recognition-help-it-depends"" id=""does-legal-recognition-help-it-depends"" title=""Permalink""></a>Does legal recognition help? It depends</h2>
<p>A key difference between these two settlements is their status in the eyes of the state. Manzoor Colony is regularised, whereas Ilyas Goth is not. But our <a class=""link--external"" href=""https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4505/adb453"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">study</a> suggests that legal recognition, also known as regularisation, is neither a pre-requisite nor a guarantee of better WASH outcomes.</p>
<p>Take Sherpao Basti, for example. Though unregularised, this settlement is located near the affluent KDA Scheme 1 and fares better than many regularised neighbourhoods. Two-thirds of households have piped water, and nearly all have on-premises flush toilets. In fact, water availability is high enough that residents from neighbouring settlements often come here to collect water.</p>
<p>Compare that with Quaid-i-Azam Colony, a recently regularised settlement that still struggles. Only one-third of households have piped water, and the rest rely on costly private borewells. Despite its legal status, this community has yet to see the benefits that regularisation is assumed to bring.</p>
<p>    <figure class=""media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven"">

    </figure></p>
<h2><a class=""heading-permalink"" href=""#the-missing-link--institutional-fragmentation"" id=""the-missing-link--institutional-fragmentation"" title=""Permalink""></a>The missing link â institutional fragmentation</h2>
<p>Why does regularisation not always improve service access? The answer lies in how Karachiâs institutions have evolved.</p>
<p>As one Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) official explained: âBefore 1996, water and sewage services in Karachi were managed as part of the KMC. Since KMC was often involved in the land acquisition process for regularisation, this allowed water and sanitation to be considered within that process. But in 1996, KWSC [Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation] became a separate utility, and itâs no longer involved in regularisation.â</p>
<p>In earlier decades, even though the Sindh Katchi Abadis Act did not formally require the water utility to provide services during regularisation, the city governmentâs integrated structure meant that WASH needs were still addressed. But today, with KWSC operating separately, that connection has broken down. Newly regularised settlements are left in a limbo, recognised by the land department but ignored by the service provider.</p>
<p>These institutional shifts make it clear that regularisation, without clear mandates for service provision, is not enough. Karachi needs to amend its processes to ensure that the utility and relevant government bodies are jointly responsible for delivering basic services to regularised settlements.</p>
<h2><a class=""heading-permalink"" href=""#more-than-pipes-and-toilets"" id=""more-than-pipes-and-toilets"" title=""Permalink""></a>More than pipes and toilets</h2>
<p>While regularisation and basic infrastructure are often seen as milestones of progress, even in settlements where these boxes are checked, residents continue to face unsafe conditions. Having taps and toilets does not always mean people have safe water or hygienic sanitation. In four of the five settlements we studied, most households technically used improved water sources and sanitation facilities. The infrastructure was there: piped connections, on-premises toilets, and in some cases, water storage systems.</p>
<p>But dig a little deeper, and a different story emerges. Intermittent water supply and poor-quality internal plumbing often result in cross-contamination between sewage and drinking water lines. Household-level water treatment is rare. Combined, this means that even with infrastructure in place, the water reaching peopleâs homes may be unsafe to drink. The result is a continued burden of disease, especially among children and the elderly, and rising health expenditures that low-income households can ill afford.</p>
<p>    <figure class=""media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven"">
        <div class=""media__item  media__item--newskitlink  "">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<h2><a class=""heading-permalink"" href=""#targeted-interventions-not-mega-projects"" id=""targeted-interventions-not-mega-projects"" title=""Permalink""></a>Targeted interventions, not mega projects</h2>
<p>Understanding why some settlements fare better than others is key to designing smarter, more equitable policies. Yet the default policy response remains the same. Policymakers continue to favour large-scale infrastructure projects, such as new pipelines and desalination plants.</p>
<p>Our findings suggests a better path forward. Improved governance, targeted investments, and community-centred solutions can yield far more sustainable outcomes. For instance, building gender-inclusive, community-managed sanitation facilities could improve both public health and dignity. Promoting low-cost household water treatment, through filters or chlorination, can significantly reduce disease burden. Supporting modest upgrades to internal plumbing networks can eliminate sources of contamination. These are not massive interventions, but they address the root causes of inequality more effectively than projects that bypass the cityâs most vulnerable residents.</p>
<p>To achieve lasting change, Karachi must adopt a more comprehensive approach to regularisation. Legal recognition must go hand in hand with actual service delivery. This means mandating that public utilities provide WASH services after a settlement is regularised. It also requires dedicated funding for improving internal infrastructure and support for civil society organisations that bridge the gap between residents and the state.</p>
<p>Not all of Karachiâs informal settlements are the same. Some are holding on. Others are struggling to survive. But all are asking for more than just a dot on the map or a connection to the main line. They need services that are safe, reliable, and affordable. If Karachi is to become a more equitable and resilient city, policymakers must move beyond infrastructure and performative legislation, and commit to meaningful, people-centred reform.</p>

Trump backs Hegseth after second scandal of sharing info on chat,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 08:26:49 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>â¢ Democrats insist US defence secretary âmust resign in disgraceâ<br />
â¢ Pentagon officials fired following probe over Yemen scandal</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump stands behind US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Monday, after <a class=""link--external"" href=""https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/20/politics/hegseth-second-signal-chat-military-plans/index.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">reports</a> that he shared details of a <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1898494"">March attack</a> on Yemenâs Houthis in a message group that included his wife, brother and personal lawyer.</p>
<p>The revelations that Hegseth used the unclassified messaging system Signal for the <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1901536"">second time</a> to share highly sensitive security details come at a delicate moment for him, with senior officials ousted from the Pentagon last week as part of investigations into alleged leaks.</p>
<p>âThe president stands strongly behind Secretary Hegseth, who is doing a phenomenal job leading the Pentagon,â Leavitt told <em>Fox News</em> host Brian Kilmeade. âAnd this is what happens when the entire Pentagon is working against you and working against the monumental change that you are trying to implement.â</p>
<p>In the second chat, Hegseth shared details of the attack similar to those <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1900541"">revealed</a> last month by <em>The Atlantic</em> magazine after its editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was included in a separate chat on the Signal app by mistake.</p>

        <div class=""media__item  media__item--newskitlink  "">    </div>
        
    </figure></p>
<p>The second chat included about a dozen people and was created during Hegsethâs confirmation process to discuss administrative issues rather than detailed military planning. Among them was Hegsethâs brother, who is a Department of Homeland Security liaison to the Pentagon. Leavitt said Hegseth shared no classified information on either Signal chat.</p>
<p>The chat included details of the schedule of the air strikes, a source familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Hegsethâs wife, Jennifer, a former <em>Fox News</em> producer, has attended sensitive meetings with foreign military counterparts, according to images the Pentagon has publicly posted. During a meeting Hegseth had with his British counterpart at the Pentagon in March, his wife could be seen sitting behind him.</p>
<p>Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell, without evidence, said that the media was âenthusiastically taking the grievances of disgruntled former employees as the sole sources for their article.â âThe Trump-hating media continues to be obsessed with destroying anyone committed to President Trumpâs agenda. Weâve already achieved so much for the American warfighter, and will never back down,â Parnell said in a statement on X.</p>
<p>The latest revelation comes days after Dan Caldwell, one of Hegsethâs leading advisers, was escorted from the Pentagon after being identified during an investigation into leaks at the Department of Defence.</p>
<p>Following Caldwellâs departure, less-senior officials Darin Selnick, who recently became Hegsethâs deputy chief of staff, and Colin Carroll, who was chief of staff to Deputy Defence Secretary Steve Feinberg, were put on administrative leave and fired on Friday.</p>
<p>White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said that ârecently fired leakers are continuing to misrepresent the truth to soothe their shattered egos and undermine the Presidentâs agenda.</p>
<p><strong>Tumultuous moment for Hegseth</strong></p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers said Hegseth could no longer stay in his job. âWe keep learning how Pete Hegseth put lives at risk,â Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a <a class=""link--external"" href=""https://x.com/SenSchumer/status/1914084912010870816"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">post</a> to X. âBut Trump is still too weak to fire him. Pete Hegseth must be fired.â</p>

<p>Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran who suffered grave injuries in combat in 2004, said that Hegseth âmust resign in disgrace.â A US official at the Pentagon questioned how Hegseth could keep his job after the latest news.</p>
<p>âWe are incredibly disappointed by the manner in which our service at the Department of Defence ended,â Caldwell <a class=""link--external"" href=""https://x.com/dandcaldwell/status/1913701312929149363"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">posted</a> on X on Saturday. âUnnamed Pentagon officials have slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door.â</p>

OIC to continue supporting Kashmirisâ right to self-determination: envoy,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 08:35:43 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>ISLAMABAD: Assistant Secretary General of OIC and Special Envoy for Jammu and Kashmir Ambassador Yousef Mohammad S. Aldobeay on Monday expressed full support for Kashmirisâ inherent right to <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1881080"">self-determination</a>.</p>
<p>Aldobeay, who was leading a delegation which met AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry here, said the OIC has condemned <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1887113"">brutalities</a> being perpetrated against the people of Indian-occupied Kashmir in the past and it will continue to raise voice for their internationally recognised right in the days ahead in an effective manner.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Barrister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry said that the OIC and its member countries should join forces and play their muchneeded role in helping resolve the longstanding Kashmir and <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1905598"">Palestine</a> issues.</p>
<p>He expressed these views during a meeting with the OIC delegation.</p>
<p>Referring to Indiaâs relentless repression of political and human rights in Kashmir, he stressed the need for intensifying efforts to resolve the lingering Kashmir dispute peacefully in accordance with the UNSC resolutions.</p>
<p>He said that there was a dire need that the Muslim countries use their diplomatic, economic and political clout to stop the bloodbath of the Kashmiri and Palestinian people who have suffered more than 70 years under brutal foreign occupation.</p>
<p>Barrister Chaudhry commended the OICâs steadfast support to Kashmirisâ just cause, stating that the Muslim body has always supported Kashmirisâ struggle.</p>
<p>Terming India and Israel two sides of the same coin, he said the fascist regimes have been engaged in systematic genocide of Palestinian and Kashmiri people.</p>
<p>Indiaâs relentless repression of political and human rights in Kashmir, he said, involved killing and maiming Kashmiris through heavy militarisation, arbitrary arrests and detention of political activists.</p>
<p>Kashmir, he said, has been turned into an open air prison where people have been deprived of all their basic rights and essential freedoms.</p>

<p>The womenâs commission is part of efforts to reform systems installed during the iron-fisted rule of Shiekh Hasina, who was <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1850270"">overthrown</a> by student-led mass protests in August 2024.</p>
<p>Hefazat-e-Islam, a platform of religious seminaries, wants the cancellation of the Womenâs Affairs Reforms Commission, set up by the caretaker government of Nobel Peace prize winner Mohammed Yunus.</p>
<p>Azizul Haque Islamabadi, a senior Hefazat-e-Islam leader, said the group opposed the commissionâs recommendation for ending discriminatory provisions against women.</p>
<p>âEnsuring equality is a Western ideology,â Islamabadi said. âThe commission recommended a uniform family code instead of Muslim family law, which governs inheritance, marriage, divorce, and other issues.â Jamaat-i-Islami, the largest religious political party, also demanded the immediate cancellation of the recommendations.</p>
<p>âRecommending initiatives to ensure equality between men and women is a malicious effort to distort Islamic ideology,â Mia Golam Parwar, secretary general of Jamaat, said in a statement. Yunus said after the commission submitted its recommendations on April 19 that  âwomen all over the world are looking at usâ.</p>
<p>Hasinaâs government was blamed for extensive human rights abuses and she took a tough stand against religious movements during her 15-year rule.</p>
<p>She is in exile in India, refusing to return to Dhaka to face charges of crimes against humanity for the killing of hundreds of protesters during the unrest that toppled her government. Bangladesh has seen a surge of open support for religious groups since her ouster.</p>

<p>The rebelsâ health ministry reported 12 dead and 34 wounded  âas a result of a raid by the US enemyâ in Farwa. Other raids were reported late Sunday in the central province of Marib, Hodeida in the west and the Houthi bastion of Saada in the north, Saba said.</p>
<p>Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree said the group launched attacks on two US aircraft carriers in response to the latest deadly American strikes. The Houthis also targeted two Israeli locations with drones, he said.</p>
<p>The US military has been carrying out almost daily attacks for the past month, saying it was targeting the  âIran-backed Houthi terroristsâ to stop attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.

<p>The remarks came after JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman visited the JI headquarters in Lahore on Monday to âdiscuss the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza and other pressing national issuesâ.</p>
<p>After the meeting, the heads of both parties held a press conference and expressed concern over the ongoing Israeli aggression in Gaza, the silence of Muslim world leaders, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperationâs weak stance on the matter.</p>
<p>JI emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman stressed that political parties should openly denounce both the United States and Israel, reiterating that the JI would continue its dialogue and cooperation with other political and religious parties, including JUI-F, but its political struggle would remain independent and platform-specific.

<p>Responding to journalistsâ questions, the JI chief categorically rejected the 26th Constitutional Amendment, stating it had weakened the judiciary. He reiterated JIâs long-standing demand for a probe into electoral rigging and asserted that instead of holding new elections, the country needed a thorough investigation into the last polls for electoral transparency.</p>
<p>Naeemur Rehman noted that this was his first meeting with Maulana Fazlur Rehman since becoming party chief and that further engagement would continue in future. Both sides agreed on the importance of upholding constitutional supremacy and stressed that all institutions must operate within their constitutional boundaries.</p>

Klaus Schwab steps down as World Economic Forum chair,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:18:50 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>ZURICH: Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum which gathers the worldâs business and political elite in the Swiss mountain village of <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1458839"">Davos</a> every year, has resigned as chair of its board of trustees, the WEF said on Monday. The Geneva-based institution had announced earlier this month that Schwab, 87, would be stepping down, without indicating a timeframe.</p>
<p>âFollowing my recent announcement, and as I enter my 88th year, I have decided to step down from the position of Chair and as a member of the Board of Trustees, with immediate effect,â Schwab said in a statement released by the WEF. The WEF board said in the statement that it had accepted Schwabâs resignation at an extraordinary meeting held on April 20, and that Vice Chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe would become the interim chairman. A committee to appoint a future chair has been established.</p>
<p>Schwab established the WEF in 1971 with the aim of creating a forum for policymakers and top corporate executives to tackle major global issues.</p>
<p>Widely regarded as a cheerleader for globalisation, the WEFâs annual Davos gathering has in recent years drawn disapproval from critics as elitist and removed from ordinary people.</p>

Work on $2bn motorway projects to start this year: minister,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 09:02:24 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan on Monday announced that construction of $2 billion <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1881038"">Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway</a> (M-6) and <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1867412"">Karachi-Hyderabad Motorway</a> (M-9) will start this year.</p>
<p>The federal minister announced this while chairing a meeting of the National Highway Authority (NHA).</p>
<p>The M-6 project, an integral part of <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1884628"">China-Pakistan Economic Corridor</a>, has already been delayed by six years.</p>
<p>In a recent meeting, a Senate panel had <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1903038"">ordered</a> the NHA to give top priority to much-awaited M-6 project.</p>
<p>The Senate Standing Committee on Planning and Development reviewed M-6 and directed the NHA to halt work on all other road projects and immediately start construction of M-6 project.</p>
<p>On the occasion, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal had assured the committee members of implementing all decisions of the panel and agreed that the first priority would be given to M-6 project.</p>
<p>In a statement last month, Mr Iqbal had said that work on the much-delayed M-6 project, along with M-9, would start next year.</p>
<p>He had also floated an option to bifurcate the whole M-6 project into three separate portions.</p>
<p>During the meeting on Monday, Mr Khan said the government also aimed to commence work on Mansehra, Naran, and Kaghan motorways in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the same period.</p>

Russia resumes attacks on Ukraine after Easter truce,"Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:14:20 +0500",Dawn (Pakistan),Pakistan,"<p>KYIV: Russia launched a wave of aerial attacks at Ukraine on Monday in an abrupt end to a fragile <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1905294/russias-putin-declares-unilateral-easter-ceasefire-in-ukraine"">Easter truce</a>, while Vladimir Putin pushed back against the idea of a month-long halt to strikes on civilian targets, as proposed by Kyiv.</p>
<p>The renewed attacks, confirmed by both Moscow and Kyiv, cast doubt on Donald Trumpâs hopes for a broader ceasefire between the two sides, hours after the US president said he hoped a âdealâ could be struck this week.</p>
<p>âMilitary action has resumed,â Putin told state TV reporters on Monday, after Ukrainian officials reported a wave of overnight drone and artillery strikes following the partially-observed 30-hour truce.</p>
<p>Each side had in any case accused the other of thousands of violations of the ceasefire, which Putin ordered in a surprise announcement on Saturday. âBut overall, there was a fall in such activity,â Putin said, after listing alleged Ukrainian violations.</p>
<blockquote class=""blockquote-level-1"">
<p>Kyivâs delegation to visit London for peace talks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>âWe welcome this and are ready to look to the future.â Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had welcomed the ceasefire and said his military would respond âsymmetricallyâ to whatever Russiaâs forces did on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Kyiv officials have accused Putin of seeking a cheap reputational victory by proposing the truce â which came hours after Trump threatened to walk away from efforts to secure peace in the three-year war if he did not see progress. The US president expressed hopes the two sides could strike an agreement in the coming days, though he did not elaborate on what he had in mind.</p>
<p>âHopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week,â he said on his Truth Social platform. Asked about Trumpâs remarks on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow âhopesâ US efforts âwill yield resultsâ.</p>
<p>Welcoming a day without air raid alerts across the country, Ukraineâs President Volodymyr Zelensky proposed âto cease any strikes using long-range drones and missiles on civilian infrastructure for a period of at least 30 days.â Putin said Russia would âanalyseâ the idea, but questioned how it would work as he accused Ukraine of using civilian buildings for military purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Ceasefire talks in London</strong></p>
<p>A Ukrainian delegation will be in London on Wednesday for ceasefire talks, as European and US officials press for a halt to Russiaâs invasion, Zelensky said. The talks will be a follow-up to a meeting in Paris last week, in which US Secretary of State Marco Rubio presented Washingtonâs plan for ending the three-year war.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump has been pushing all sides to accept a ceasefire, but has failed to extract any major concessions from the Kremlin despite repeated negotiations and a brief truce announced by Russiaâs Vladimir Putin over Easter.</p>
<p>âAlready this Wednesday, our representatives will be working in London. Ukraine, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States â we are ready to move forward as constructively as possible,â Zelensky said on X on Monday.</p>
<p>âAn unconditional ceasefire must be the first step toward peace,â he added. Zelensky did not say who else would attend, but Rubio suggested earlier that a US delegation would take part.</p>
