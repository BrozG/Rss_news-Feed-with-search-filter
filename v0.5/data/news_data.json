Depois do achado, escavações apontaram mais 30 fósseis no local. Descoberta de fóssil que deu origem a Museu de Monte Alto completa 40 anos\nEm uma manhã de abril de 1985, Elvira Aparecida Franciosi, então estudante de História e Geografia, descobriria algo que colocaria Monte Alto (SP) no mapa do mundo da paleontologia. \nSiga o canal g1 Ribeirão e Franca no WhatsApp \nEla pastorava o gado em uma área próxima ao sítio da família, quando algo entre as rochas chamou a atenção. \nElvira ainda não sabia, mas estava diante de um fóssil de dinossauro, o primeiro encontrado na região e que, posteriormente, daria início ao Museu de Paleontologia de Monte Alto, um dos mais importantes da América Latina. \n\"Eu tinha muita vaca de leite, então, tirava o leite e levava o gado pastorear naquele [campo] aberto lá, onde não tinha uma casa. Pastorava o gado lá. Eu estava a cavalo e descia do cavalo para ficar olhando. Então, eu encontrei o fóssil\". \nPrimeiro fóssil de Titanossauro encontrado em Monte Alto (SP) completa 40 anos em abril\nArquivo pessoal\nA rocha onde o fóssil estava, ficava em uma valeta que se formou por conta da erosão do solo. \nO ponto exato foi coberto pelo asfalto ao longo dos anos, mas Elvira sabe bem como identificar: é uma mancha bem ao lado da sinalização de solo 'Pare'. (veja imagem abaixo)\nA área, antes tomada pela terra, virou o bairro residencial Jardim Paulista, e ficou conhecida como Estrada do Campestre, porque é caminho para o clube de lazer de Monte Alto. \nValeta onde foi encontrado o primeiro fóssil de dinossauro de Monte Alto (SP) foi coberta pelo asfalto\nTiago Aureliano/EPTV\nDepois do primeiro fóssil encontrado por Elvira, equipes de escavações descobriram outros 30 no mesmo local. \nAnos mais tarde, pesquisadores identificaram que todos eles se tratavam de fósseis do Titanossauro do Campestre, uma espécie de dinossauro herbívoro que viveu na região de Monte Alto entre 70 e 83 milhões de anos.\nEscavações encontraram mais 30 fósseis no mesmo lugar onde primeiro fóssil de Monte Alto (SP) foi achado\nArquivo pessoal\n'Sabia que não era osso de boi'\nElvira tinha 20 anos na época que encontrou o primeiro fóssil. Hoje, aos 62, ela lembra do dia em que tudo aconteceu e diz que a única certeza que tinha era de que não se tratava de um osso comum.\n\"Eu sempre trabalhei no matadouro, eu sempre matei muito gado, então conheço a ossada toda de um boi. Eu vi que não era de um boi, mas achei que era a paleta de um bicho\". \nElvira Franciosi e a réplica do esqueleto do Titanossauro do Campeste, em Monte Alto (SP): primeiro fóssil foi encontrado por ela há 40 anos\nTiago Aureliano/EPTV\nAo g1, ela contou que chegou a falar do assunto para o professor da faculdade, mas ele não deu tanta importância à descoberta. \nFoi então que o pai de Elvira avisou o professor Antônio Celso de Arruda Campos, paleontólogo autodidata e o principal responsável pela escavação para a retirada do primeiro fóssil de Monte Alto, há 40 anos.\n\"Meu pai, um dia conversando com o professor Antônio Celso no posto de gasolina, falou 'a Lila encontrou um negócio esquisito'. Aí o Celso foi lá e viu com o farolete, à noite mesmo. Clareou lá e viu que era um fóssil. Aí começou toda a história do osso do dinossauro\". \nAs escavações no local duraram quase cinco anos. Como Monte Alto ainda não tinha um museu, cada fóssil encontrado era armazenado nas casas de Antônio Celso e Cledinei Aparecido Francisco, que tinha 16 anos à época e fazia parte da equipe.\n\"A gente se reunia para caçar dinossauros, ficava sábado e domingo. Ficamos meses para retirar. Foram várias etapas, pelo menos quatro ou cinco etapas de grandes escavações. Até que, então, finalzinho de 1990 a gente vai acabar com todo o cenário das escavações\", diz Cledinei.\nLEIA TAMBÉM\nDia do paleontólogo: como se tornar um profissional que desvenda a vida no passado remoto da Terra\nMonte Alto: terra dos dinossauros; FOTOS\nDesde a criação do museu, em 1992, Cledinei trabalha no local. Hoje, ele é auxiliar de paleontologia. \nAntônio Celso, que dá nome ao espaço, morreu em 2015.\nAntônio Celso de Arruda Campos, paleontólogo autodidata e o principal responsável pela escavação para a retirada do primeiro fóssil de Monte Alto (SP)\nArquivo pessoal\nPedido especial ao prefeito\nCoordenadora do Museu de Paleontologia de Monte Alto, Sandra Tavares conta que a criação do museu só foi possível por conta do esforço político de Antônio Celso.\nDepois de muitos fósseis armazenados na própria casa, a mulher do professor começou a pedir que eles fossem retirados do local. Antônio Celso, então, passou a insistir por um espaço diretamente com o prefeito da época, Elias Bahdur. \n\"Eles colocaram [os fósseis] em uma salinha que já existia e ele pedindo 'preciso de um espaço maior, preciso de um espaço maior'. Aí o doutor Elias, que na época era o prefeito, falou 'vou te fazer um museu'. E fez. E construiu o museu. Foi por esforço político do professor Antônio Celso que ele conseguiu o museu\", diz Sandra.\nO Museu de Paleontologia fica no Centro Cívico e Cultural Doutor Elias Bahdur, na Praça do Centenário, no Centro da cidade. O espaço abriga também o Museu Histórico e o Museu de Arqueologia.\nO complexo virou referência nacional e internacional por conta do acervo inédito de espécies de diferentes animais pré-históricos.\n\"Tornou-se uma referência muito grande, porque nossa coleção é bem significante e que atrai pesquisadores e o público em geral. Se eu tenho um fóssil inédito na mão, da mesma forma que eu tenho de comparar com os fósseis já descritos em outros países, os pesquisadores de outros países também tem de comparar o trabalho deles com o nosso\".\nPara Sandra, o museu tem grande importância não só para a pesquisa, mas também para a popularização da ciência e da paleontologia. \nOs primeiros fósseis do museu\nOs primeiros fósseis do museu foram justamente aqueles encontrados na Estrada do Campestre. Após as escavações, eles ainda foram objeto de estudos nos anos seguintes, já com um espaço específico para isso. \nMas o trabalho de identificação é extremamente longo e só em 2000 pesquisadores descobriram que aquele encontrado por Elvira se tratava do fêmur de um Titanossauro. \nFêmur de um Titanossauro do Campestre, primeiro fóssil encontrado em Monte Alto (SP), em 1985\nTiago Aureliano/EPTV\nPor ter sido encontrada na Estrada do Campestre, a espécie recebeu o nome de Titanossauro do Campestre. \nMas os estudos com os fósseis descoberto naquela região ainda não terminaram. Segundo Sandra, a ideia, agora, é produzir um artigo científico.\n\"Estamos trabalhando na descrição dos fósseis encontrados em 1985 no Campestre e que deram origem a criação do museu. O estudo acontece em parceria com pesquisadores da USP, Unicamp e UFRJ. Em 2017, alguns destes pesquisadores envolvidos neste estudo estiveram no museu e me pediram para olhar esses fósseis e, de lá pra cá, o artigo está sendo produzido\". \nAinda segundo a paleontóloga, há  indícios de que os fósseis pertençam a, pelo menos, três indivíduos: um adulto e, talvez, dois jovens. \nA proposta do artigo, diz Sandra, é afirmar uma nova espécie. Se isto acontecer, os pesquisadores vão decidir o nome científico que será dado ao Titanossauro do Campestre.\nVeja mais notícias da região no g1 Ribeirão Preto e Franca\nVÍDEOS: Tudo sobre Ribeirão Preto e região",

Mudou radicalmente seu estilo de vida e, aos 80, irá da Califórnia à Flórida para oferecer uma mensagem de esperança. No dia 5 de abril, Judy Benjamin iniciou sua caminhada de 3 mil milhas (cerca de 4.8 mil quilômetros). Aos 80 anos, partiu de San Diego, na Califórnia, e pretende chegar a Saint Augustine, na Flórida, em seis meses. Por trás dessa empreitada, que seria árdua em qualquer idade, uma causa que a mobiliza: aumentar a conscientização sobre a Doença de Alzheimer. \nJudy Benjamin: caminhada de quase 5 mil quilômetros para aumentar a conscientização sobre o Alzheimer\nDivulgação\nSua mãe lutou contra a enfermidade durante duas décadas e a própria Judy foi diagnosticada há 13 anos. Desde então, mudou radicalmente seu estilo de vida para retardar ao máximo a progressão da doença, e procura oferecer uma mensagem de esperança: a de que é possível combater os sintomas do Alzheimer. Sua jornada não será solitária. Ela terá uma equipe de suporte e outra de filmagem, para a produção de um documentário. O objetivo é percorrer 20 milhas (32 quilômetros) diariamente, com um dia descanso por semana.\nJudy segue um rigoroso protocolo voltado para prevenir o declínio mental, criado pelo médico Dale Bredesen, que a considera seu “paciente zero”. O sucesso do tratamento a transformou em coach de bem-estar. “Quero compartilhar com as pessoas que é possível conviver com o Alzheimer e ser saudável, espero que se sintam encorajadas”, diz. \nO diagnóstico, aos 67 anos, não a surpreendeu. Os sintomas começaram pouco depois da morte da mãe, que havia sido diagnosticada aos 63 anos – nove tios tinham o mesmo problema. “Eu não me lembrava dos nomes dos netos, tinha dificuldade de ler o jornal e esquecia até o número do meu celular”, conta.\nFoi quando descobriu o doutor Bredesen e adotou seu programa, que incluía melhorar a qualidade do sono, fazer meditação e uma rotina vigorosa de exercícios, além de uma dieta saudável, com alimentos integrais e sem açúcar. “Ele me explicou que o Alzheimer não é causado por uma única coisa, e sim por uma série de agressões ao cérebro”, afirmou.",

O momento da conversa ficou registrado e ela descreve o encontro como inesquecível.\n\"Foi um dia inesquecível na minha vida, que eu vou levar para a história do meu casamento, para os meus filhos e nunca vou esquecer os dois conselhos que ele nos deu: Que nós nunca terminássemos o dia brigados, e que um fosse sempre muito companheiro do outro\", contou Raquel. \n✅ Clique e siga o canal do g1 GO no WhatsApp\nA advogada conversou com o g1, e contou que o encontro do casal com o sumo pontífice foi em 13 de novembro de 2024, quando eles estiveram em Roma.  \n\"Nós nos casamos 22 de junho de 2024.

Raquel contou que o papa tinha perguntado de onde ela e o marido eram, e quando eles revelaram ser brasileiros o pontífice brincou. \n\"Ele terminou falando que cachaça é bom, por isso que no final do vídeo todo mundo começa a dar gargalhada\", contou Raquel. \nLegado \nOs 12 anos em que Francisco ficou à frente da Igreja Católica foram marcados pela visão humilde e misericordiosa em defesa dos pobres, e pelas mensagens de acolhimento e amor.  \nRaquel lembra um dos livros escritos pelo papa Francisco, que se chama 'O Nome de Deus é Misericórdia', como uma marca que o papa deixa. \n\"Eu acho que o legado dele é esse, que a gente sempre tente olhar com amor quem está por perto, porque esse olhar misericordioso e amoroso, ele muda as coisas, muda as pessoas\", finalizou. \nRaquel Maria Pedro Saad e o marido Pérsio Antunes\nArquivo pessoal/Raquel Maria\nÚltima aparição\nA última aparição pública do papa Francisco coincidiu com a festa da Páscoa, principal data do calendário católico, em que os cristãos comemoram a ressurreição de Jesus Cristo. No domingo de Páscoa (20), o pontífice fez questão de dar a benção para os fiéis que lotaram a praça São Pedro, no Vaticano.\nA voz do santo padre estava fraca por causa dos problemas de saúde, e mesmo com as recomendações médicas ele fez questão de passar com o papamóvel próximo da multidão de fiéis e cumprimentou as crianças que estavam presentes.\nMorte do papa\nJorge Mario Bergoglio, o papa Francisco, morreu aos 88 anos dentro de seu apartamento, a residência de Santa Marta. O imóvel fica na Cidade do Vaticano e era onde o pontífice vivia desde 2013, quando foi eleito.\n\"O Bispo de Roma, Francisco, retornou à casa do Pai. Toda a sua vida foi dedicada ao serviço do Senhor e de Sua Igreja. Ele nos ensinou a viver os valores do Evangelho com fidelidade, coragem e amor universal, especialmente em favor dos mais pobres e marginalizados\", disse o Vaticano em comunicado.\nSegundo a certidão médica que atestou a morte, o papa sofreu um AVC cerebral, entrou em coma e teve um colapso cardiocirculatório irreversível às 7h35, no horário de Roma (2h35 em Brasília).\nO boletim médico informa que o quadro foi agravado por pneumonia bilateral, bronquiectasias múltiplas, hipertensão e diabetes tipo 2. A morte foi confirmada por um exame de eletrocardiograma.\nAs cerimônias fúnebres de Francisco seguirão uma série de ritos e começaram já nesta segunda-feira, segundo o Vaticano. Os horários a seguir estão no horário de Brasília:\n14h: missa de sufrágio pelo papa Francisco. Cerimônia ocorreu na Basílica de São João de Latrão, em Roma, e foi realizada pelo cardeal Baldo Reina. \n15h: ritos de constatação da morte e deposição do corpo de Francisco no caixão. A cerimônia ocorreu na capela privada do papa e foi presidida pelo camerlengo Farrell. \nNa manhã de quarta-feira (23), o corpo do papa será levado para a Basílica de São Pedro, em Roma, para que fiéis possam prestar a última homenagem ao papa. \nFrancisco será enterrado na Basílica de Santa Maria Maggiore, em Roma, e não na Basílica de São Pedro, no Vaticano. A última vez que isso aconteceu foi em 1903, com o enterro do papa Leão XIII.\n📱 Veja outras notícias da região no g1 Goiás.",

Não é fácil fazer o que muitos críticos – e parte considerável do público – considera como \"a melhor coisa (série ou filme, tanto faz) de 'Star Wars' desde a primeira trilogia\". Por isso que \"Andor\" estreia sua segunda e última temporada nesta terça-feira (22) com uma mudança considerável de percurso.\nAinda antes de seu lançamento, em 2022, o plano era que cada temporada retratasse um ano da vida de seu protagonista até sua conclusão – mostrada no filme \"Rogue One: Uma história Star Wars\" (2016). É o que aconteceu na primeira e elogiada temporada. \nNa segunda, a equipe liderada pelo criador e roteirista Tony Gilroy e o astro e produtor-executivo Diego Luna liga o hiperpropulsor para chegar a seu destino em 12 parsecs ou menos.\n\"Não havia outra maneira de fazer. Nos sentamos na metade da primeira temporada. Estávamos filmando na Escócia. Tony veio e sentamos e falamos sobre como era impossível fazer cinco temporadas disso\", diz o ator mexicano em entrevista ao g1.\n\"Era a única forma de terminar.\"\nDiego Luna em cena de 'Andor'\nDivulgação\nQuando Luna estrelou o filme, tinha cerca de 37 anos. Com os dois anos e meio necessários para fazer uma única temporada, chegaria ao final da série – e começo da história de \"Rogue One\" – com o rostinho de 53. Difícil explicar tamanha diferença.\nPor isso, os novos 12 episódios são agrupados em grupos de três, com cada trio focado em um ano da vida do herói disponível semanalmente na plataforma de vídeos Disney+.\n\"Acho que é uma ótima ideia, porque pensamos em filmes. Esses são quatro filmes, basicamente. Fizemos quatro filmes e cada um deles cobre o que uma temporada ia cobrir. Achei que foi genial\", afirma o ator.\n\"Desde que eu comecei 'Rogue One' já são dez anos da minha vida, cara. E eu estou feliz que tivemos essa ideia, e feliz que terminamos no auge, quando ainda amamos o que fazemos, apaixonados, animados por fazê-lo.\" \n\"É assim que se termina. É isso o que esse personagem e essa história merecem.\"\nKyle Soller e Denise Gough em cena de 'Andor'\nDivulgação\nO lado mais sombrio\n\"Andor\" continua a história da formação do futuro herói da Aliança Rebelde, que no filme é um dos responsáveis pelo roubo dos projetos da Estrela da Morte – um ponto crucial para a derrota do maligno Império Galáctico.\nOs episódios recebem novidades nem tão novas assim, como a já anunciada adesão de Ben Mendelsohn e seu odioso diretor Krennic, e o retorno de veteranos da série, como Kyle Soller, Stellan Skarsgard, Genevieve O'Reilly e Denise Gough.\nA temporada também ajuda a aprofundar o relacionamento de Andor com a mecânica Bix (Adria Arjona) e as discussões sobre o lado mais sombrio de uma luta rebelde – temas mais maduros dentro do universo \"Star Wars\".\n\"É incrivelmente animador meio que ser esse reflexo de espelho da nossa história, e não necessariamente da nossa história de agora, desse momento, mas há muitas coisas que vemos nessa temporada, e algumas em que eu estou, que são reflexo do que acontece no nosso mundo\", diz Arjona.\n\"A experiência de ser uma mulher neste mundo. O uso errado do poder. Ou todos esses temas. E é incrível atuar isso e é incrível trazer esse realismo a 'Star Wars'.\"\nDiego Luna e Adria Arjona em cena de 'Andor'\nDivulgação",

Durante a visita, o pontífice perguntou sobre a saúde do presidente Lula e expressou seu apoio à Aliança Global Contra a Fome e a Pobreza, uma iniciativa do governo brasileiro.\nLula fala sobre paixão do papa Francisco pelo futebol: 'O mais brasileiro dos argentinos'\nEm uma rede social, Janja mencionou estar muito emocionada e agradeceu pelas orações do papa pela recuperação de Lula.\nDuas semanas depois, Lula e Janja realizaram uma missa na capela do Palácio da Alvorada pela saúde do papa Francisco, que à época, estava internado para tratar uma dupla pneumonia. A missa foi conduzida por três padres jesuítas e contou com a presença de Dom Raymundo Damasceno, Cardeal e Arcebispo Emérito de Aparecida.\nBolsonaro teve relação distante de Francisco\nJair Bolsonaro e o papa Francisco tiveram divergências em temas sociais e ambientais. Durante seu mandato, Bolsonaro não se encontrou com o pontífice, mas suas declarações e políticas frequentemente contrastaram com as mensagens públicas do líder da Igreja Católica.\nBolsonaro respondeu a um tweet de Francisco sobre a Amazônia. Bolsonaro afirmou que a Amazônia pertence ao Brasil e disse que o papa não tem conhecimento sobre a realidade da região. Em sua publicação, Francisco pediu a união do mundo em torno da preservação da Amazônia e os direitos das pessoas que vivem na região.\nPresidente Bolsonaro rebate comentário do Papa: 'Amazônia é nossa'\nEm 2021, o ex-presidente foi à Roma para participar da cúpula do G20, mas não se reuniu com o papa Francisco – que recebeu a visita de outros chefes de Estado como o então presidente dos Estados Unidos, Joe Biden. \nEm 2022, Francisco enviou uma carta a Bolsonaro prestando condolências pela morte da mãe do então presidnete, Olinda Bonturi Bolsonaro. Francisco disse que Olinda teve um “belo testemunho cristão, tanto no desempenho da sua missão familiar como na solícita colaboração prestada à vida eclesial”.\nBolsonaro lamentou a morte de Francisco e disse que \"a figura do papa sempre foi sinal de unidade, esperança e orientação moral\".\nA ex-primeira-dama Michelle Bolsonaro não chegou a se reunir de forma reservada com Francisco, mas participou de um encontro com o pontífice em 2019, em Roma, durante uma reunião com um grupo de primeiras-damas latino-americanas.\nDilma foi primeira lídere recebida pelo papa\nA ex-presidente Dilma Rousseff teve alguns encontros significativos com o papa Francisco durante seu mandato e após sua saída da Presidência da República. \nO primeiro encontro ocorreu logo após a missa inaugural do pontífice em 2013, quando Dilma foi a primeira chefe de Estado a ser recebida pelo papa argentino após a cerimônia que deu início ao pontificado. Ainda em 2013, eles se encontraram novamente durante a Jornada Mundial da Juventude (JMJ), realizada no Rio de Janeiro .\nEm abril de 2024, já como presidente do Banco dos BRICS, Rousseff se reuniu novamente com Francisco. \nEncontro com Temer em canonização\nEm abril de 2014, Michel Temer, então vice-presidente, representou o Brasil na missa de canonização do Padre José de Anchieta, dirigida pelo papa Francisco no Vaticano.\nOutro encontro importante encontrao foi no ano anterior, durante a Jornada Mundial da Juventude, realizada no Rio de Janeiro em julho de 2013. Temer participou das atividades ao lado do pontífice, que visitou o Brasil para o evento.",

Venezuela, México e Estados Unidos são alguns dos países que ele afirma ter passado. Baiano encontrado na Costa Rica após três anos diz que fez 'bicos' para se sustentar e teve apoio de outros imigrantes\nReprodução/TV Bahia\nO baiano que foi deportado da Costa Rica, após entrar ilegalmente no país, disse que fez ''bicos'' para se sustentar durante os três anos que esteve longe de casa, como lavar carros e realizar pequenos serviços em uma borracharia. Ele contou também que teve ajuda de outros imigrantes, de quem recebeu abrigo em alguns momentos, e passou por pelo menos outras seis nações levando apenas a Carteira Nacional de Habilitação (CNH).\nMarisvaldo dos Santos Silva conversou com o g1 em Salvador, com exclusividade, pouco depois de retornar para a família. A deportação aconteceu no domingo (20), após o baiano ser flagrado sem documentação adequada no país.\nO homem chegou no Brasil por Guarulhos (SP) e seguiu, sozinho, para a capital baiana, onde foi recepcionado pela mãe. Marisvaldo dos Santos estava sumido desde junho de 2022, quando saiu da casa do irmão, em Camaçari, cidade na Região Metropolitana de Salvador (RMS), para pedalar.\nMas não foi só de bicicleta que o homem viajou. Segundo ele, barcos e ônibus também o ajudaram a se deslocar entre os países que percorreu. O baiano conta que o último ponto que esteve no Brasil antes de partir para o exterior foi Roraima. \nAinda conforme Marisvaldo, de lá, ele seguiu para a Venezuela, passando também por Colômbia, Panamá e Guatemala, até o México, onde ficou a maior parte do tempo e chegou a estar em um relacionamento. \nHá cerca de dois anos, o baiano conta que conseguiu entrar ilegalmente nos Estados Unidos, porém foi deportado, voltando para o México. Depois, conforme relatou, ele seguiu para Costa Rica, até que foi pego. \nBaiano encontrado na Costa Rica após sumir por três anos desembarca no Brasil\nDe volta à terra natal, Marisvaldo contou que nesses três anos não entrou em contato com os familiares para não preocupar ninguém.\n\"Como toda família, temos nossos desafios e temos que lutar, tentar apagar as coisas do passado, tentar criar um futuro melhor. Mas eu estou muito feliz\", contou. \nO sentimento é compartilhado pela mãe do baiano, mas ainda há preocupação. Maria dos Santos contou que o filho não aceita o diagnóstico de esquizofrenia e, por isso, não recebe acompanhamento médico adequado, e nem usa os medicamentos necessários. \n\"Eu estou bem, estou feliz que ele está de volta depois desses três anos. Minha vida era chorar, ficar preocupada, mas, graças a Deus, ele voltou. Vai ficar comigo, com meu cuidado. Não imagino como foram esses anos\". \nReencontro\nBaiano encontrado na Costa Rica revê mãe em Salvador após três anos desaparecido\nMarisvaldo dos Santos reviu a mãe, na madrugada de segunda-feira (21), depois de três anos longe de casa. Ele foi recepcionado no Aeroporto Internacional de Salvador por familiares, que buscavam pelo paradeiro dele desde o desaparecimento.\nEm um vídeo feito pela família para o g1, o baiano e a mãe, Maria dos Santos, se abraçam, enquanto ela comemora o reencontro: \"Estou tão feliz que meu filho apareceu depois de três anos desaparecido. Só Jesus mesmo\", disse.\nConforme informou a mãe de Marisvaldo, nesse primeiro momento, ele ficará na casa dela, no bairro de Pernambués, na capital baiana. Depois, o baiano deve seguir para um imóvel onde ele chegou a morar antes de desaparecer, na mesma região.\nInicialmente, o homem chegaria à terra natal de ônibus, porque, segundo a família, as passagens estavam caras e eles não teriam condições de arcar com o custo. \nNo entanto, os familiares de Marisvaldo conseguiram parcelar o valor no cartão de crédito e encurtaram a viagem. Na estrada, o percurso passaria de um dia e meio de viagem. De avião, foi de menos de três horas.\nEsta não é a primeira vez que ele desaparece. Em 2020, no início da pandemia da Covid-19, o homem saiu de bicicleta e só foi localizado dias depois no Espírito Santo. O fato de ter esquizofrenia e não estar tomando a medicação pode ter sido o motivo para que saísse de casa mais uma vez, acredita a mãe. \nLEIA MAIS:\nSantuário e Polícia Civil afirmam que romeiro desaparecido não subiu morro considerado sagrado na Bahia\nCabeleireiro desaparecido após viajar para participar de evento na Bahia é encontrado\nBaiano encontrado na Costa Rica revê mãe na Bahia\nArquivo Pessoal\nApós 3 anos baiano é encontrado na Costa Rica\nVeja mais notícias do estado no g1 Bahia.\nAssista aos vídeos do g1 e TV Bahia 💻",

Corte pode abrir processo penal contra o grupo.  STF recebe primeiras defesas dos denunciados por envolvimento em tentativa de golpe\nJornal Nacional/ Reprodução\nA Primeira Turma do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) vai começar a analisar, na próxima terça-feira (22), a denúncia da Procuradoria-Geral da República contra outros seis acusados de participação na tentativa de golpe de Estado em 2022.\nSão eles:\nFernando de Sousa Oliveira, delegado da Polícia Federal (PF) e ex-secretário-executivo da Secretaria de Segurança Pública (SSP)\nMarcelo Costa Câmara, coronel da reserva do Exército e ex-assessor do ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro\nFilipe Garcia Martins Pereira, ex-assessor especial de Assuntos Internacionais de Bolsonaro\nMarília Ferreira de Alencar, ex-diretora de Inteligência do Ministério da Justiça na gestão de Anderson Torres\nMário Fernandes, ex-número dois da Secretaria-Geral da Presidência, general da reserva e homem de confiança de Bolsonaro\nSilvinei Vasques, ex-diretor-geral da Polícia Rodoviária Federal (PRF)\nO colegiado vai avaliar se o pedido deve ser admitido, ou seja, se deve ser aberta uma ação penal.\nProcesso que tem Bolsonaro e sete aliados réus por tentativa de golpe de Estado já tem os próximos passos definidos\nO grupo é acusado de cinco crimes. Dois deles estão em uma lei que combate os ataques à democracia. Da forma como estão previstos na legislação, a tentativa de deposição do governo já é suficiente para a configuração da ação ilegal. \nOu seja, na prática, já é possível punir a tentativa de atacar as instituições, mesmo que a ruptura do regime democrático não tenha se concretizado.\nOs crimes são:\nabolição violenta do Estado Democrático de Direito: pune o ato de \"tentar, com emprego de violência ou grave ameaça, abolir o Estado Democrático de Direito, impedindo ou restringindo o exercício dos poderes constitucionais\". A pena varia de 4 a 8 anos de prisão.\ngolpe de Estado: fica configurado quando uma pessoa tenta \"depor, por meio de violência ou grave ameaça, o governo legitimamente constituído\". A punição é a prisão, no período de 4 a 12 anos.\nO grupo também é acusado de:\norganização criminosa: quando quatro ou mais pessoas se reúnem, de forma ordenada e com divisão de tarefas, para cometer crimes. Pena de 3 a 8 anos.\ndano qualificado: destruir, inutilizar ou deteriorar coisa alheia, com violência e grave ameaça, contra o patrimônio da União, e com considerável prejuízo para a vítima. Pena de seis meses a três anos.\ndeterioração de patrimônio tombado: destruir, inutilizar ou deteriorar bem especialmente protegido por lei, ato administrativo ou decisão judicial. Pena de um a três anos.\nLei que protege a democracia\nProjeto que revoga Lei de Segurança Nacional inclui novos crimes contra a democracia; entenda\nOs dois primeiros delitos foram incluídos na legislação penal pela lei que protege o Estado Democrático de Direito, aprovada em 2021 e assinada pelo próprio ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro.\nComo o objetivo da regra é proteger o funcionamento das instituições democráticas, já criminalizam o próprio ato de usar de violência ou ameaça para tentar subverter a ordem. Não exigem que o golpe tenha se concretizado para que a punição seja aplicada.\nIsso acontece porque, se ocorre uma ruptura violenta, o Estado Democrático de Direito deixa de existir. Assim, as forças democráticas que foram derrotadas não teriam como promover a responsabilização dos infratores.\nNeste caso, os próprios infratores, ao se consolidarem no poder, podem mudar as regras até então estabelecidas no regime democrático anterior para evitar punições.\nAnálise da denúncia\nNeste primeiro momento, a Primeira Turma do STF verifica se a denúncia pode ser admitida, ou seja, se ela tem elementos mínimos que apontam que os delitos foram praticados e que os autores são os acusados.\nSe a denúncia receber o aval para tramitar, abre-se um processo penal em que serão ouvidas as partes e colhidas provas.\nEncerrada esta etapa, o caso segue para julgamento. Será neste momento que os ministros vão avaliar se o grupo deve ser punido ou não. E, se houver condenação, o tamanho da pena.\n➡️No último dia 11, o Supremo abriu uma ação penal contra o ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro e mais sete aliados por participação na tentativa de golpe de Estado. Este núcleo, chamado de \"crucial\" está na etapa das prévias.",

Papa Francisco \nBruno Miani/A Tribuna Jornal\nJorge Mario Bergoglio nasceu e viveu a maior parte de sua vida em Buenos Aires, onde construiu uma carreira eclesiástica marcada pelo serviço aos mais pobres. Tornou-se padre e cardeal até que, em março de 2013, foi eleito para o cargo mais alto da Igreja Católica. Na história, foi o primeiro pontífice latino-americano, o primeiro jesuíta e o primeiro a adotar o nome Francisco. \nEm 12 anos de papado, Francisco promoveu uma modernização dentro da Igreja. Avaliado por muitos como um líder progressista, se posicionou sempre pelos mais vulneráveis, discursou contra guerras e contra a desigualdade social e trabalhou para abrir portas a mulheres e pessoas da comunidade LGBTQIA+.  \nA trajetória do Santo Padre à frente do Vaticano se encerrou nesta segunda-feira (21).

Entenda a tradição. Papa Francisco recebe o Anel do Pescador na primeira missa após assumir o posto, em 2013\nStefano Rellandin/Reuters\nVários rituais e cerimônias tradicionais da Igreja Católica estão previstos para acontecer nos próximos dias em celebração ao papa Francisco, morto aos 88 anos nesta segunda-feira (21). Entre os ritos que já ocorreram, está a quebra do Anel do Pescador, ou seja, o anel papal.\nO Anel do Pescador\nCada papa usa um anel feito sob medida com a imagem gravada de um homem pescando de um barco, uma referência ao evangelho de Mateus, onde Jesus chama São Pedro de “pescador de homens”.\nEsse Anel do Pescador, com o nome do papa gravado sobre a imagem, poderia ser usado como selo em documentos oficiais. O camerlengo quebra o anel e destrói o selo com um martelo ou outro instrumento, para impedir que outra pessoa o use.\nAnel do pescador na mão do papa Francisco\nReuters\nO anel de Francisco foi quebrado após seus aposentos serem selados, na tarde desta segunda. Esse é outro rito — no caso, para vetar o acesso aos locais até a eleição de um novo pontífice. \nGeralmente, o Anel do Pescador é usado na mão direita do papa em seu dedo anelar. O acessório é tradicionalmente feito de ouro, mas Francisco usava um anel de prata banhado a ouro, por escolha própria.\nO papa Francisco terá uma última homenagem na manhã desta quarta-feira (23), com fiéis velando seu corpo na Basílica de São Pedro. Seu caixão ficará ali por três dias seguidos para, depois, ser levado até à Basílica Santa Maria Maggiore, onde será enterrado. \nRelembre 5 momentos da entrevista do Papa ao Fantástico em 2013",

O chamado \"núcleo 2\" da organização é acusado de realizar o gerenciamento das ações ilícitas.\nFazem parte deste grupo:\nFernando de Sousa Oliveira, delegado da Polícia Federal (PF) e ex-secretário-executivo da Secretaria de Segurança Pública do Distrito Federal (SSP)\nMarcelo Costa Câmara, coronel da reserva do Exército e ex-assessor do ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro\nFilipe Garcia Martins Pereira, ex-assessor especial de Assuntos Internacionais de Bolsonaro\nMarília Ferreira de Alencar, ex-diretora de Inteligência do Ministério da Justiça na gestão de Anderson Torres\nMário Fernandes, ex-número dois da Secretaria-Geral da Presidência, general da reserva e homem de confiança de Bolsonaro\nSilvinei Vasques, ex-diretor-geral da Polícia Rodoviária Federal (PRF)\nProcesso que tem Bolsonaro e sete aliados réus por tentativa de golpe de Estado já tem os próximos passos definidos\nSe a acusação for aceita pelo colegiado, um processo penal será aberto para verificar o grau de participação de cada um nos delitos.\nDos cinco crimes, três estão previstos no Código Penal. O quarto está em uma lei de 2013 e o quinto, em uma norma de 1998.\nO g1 detalha o que prevê a legislação sobre as condutas e as penas:\nabolição violenta do Estado Democrático de Direito: acontece quando alguém tenta \"com emprego de violência ou grave ameaça, abolir o Estado Democrático de Direito, impedindo ou restringindo o exercício dos poderes constitucionais\". A pena varia de 4 a 8 anos de prisão.\ngolpe de Estado: fica configurado quando uma pessoa tenta \"depor, por meio de violência ou grave ameaça, o governo legitimamente constituído\". A punição é prisão, no período de 4 a 12 anos.\norganização criminosa: quando quatro ou mais pessoas se reúnem, de forma ordenada e com divisão de tarefas, para cometer crimes. Pena de 3 a 8 anos.\ndano qualificado: destruir, inutilizar ou deteriorar coisa alheia, com violência e grave ameaça, contra o patrimônio da União, e com considerável prejuízo para a vítima. Pena de seis meses a três anos.\ndeterioração de patrimônio tombado: destruir, inutilizar ou deteriorar bem especialmente protegido por lei, ato administrativo ou decisão judicial. Pena de um a três anos.\nA proposta da PGR é que o grupo seja condenado à prisão e que as penas dos delitos sejam somadas. Ou seja, considerando as punições máximas previstas nas regras penais, as penas podem chegar a, pelo menos, 36 anos.\nNo entanto, esta definição só vai ocorrer se houver um processo penal e, ao final, julgamento pela condenação do grupo. \nNeste ponto, caberá ao Supremo fixar a pena de cada um, de forma individual. Assim, avaliando as circunstâncias do caso, os ministros podem verificar situações que agravam ou atenuam a punição.",

Circuito registra momento em Wanderson Honorato é atacado\nA polícia procura pelo suspeito de matar um entregador, de 24 anos, com uma facada no pescoço na tarde de sábado (20), na Avenida Raja Gabaglia, na Região Oeste de Belo Horizonte.  Segundo a família, o crime aconteceu depois de uma discussão entre o irmão da vítima e outro entregador, que também prestava serviço para um supermercado online.\nImagens de uma câmera de segurança registraram o momento em Wanderson Honorato Ferraz é atingido pelo golpe (veja vídeo acima). Ele trabalhava como entregador e morreu em frente à central de distribuição do supermercado.\nO pai de Wanderson, Paulo Ferraz,  pede que o suspeito seja localizado e a justiça seja feita. \n“Deus há de fazer justiça pra mim, porque ele era um filho maravilhoso.

Antes de morrer, Francisco fez mudanças para simplificar rituais fúnebres. Entenda como será o funeral do papa Francisco\nA morte de um papa dá início a uma série de ritos e cerimônias cuidadosamente organizadas muito antes do início do Conclave para eleger o sucessor. Elas envolvem a certificação da morte e a exibição pública do corpo para que os fiéis possam prestar homenagens, além do funeral e do sepultamento.\nO papa Francisco, que morreu nesta segunda-feira (21), revisou diversos ritos no ano passado, simplificando os rituais funerários para enfatizar seu papel como um simples bispo. Ele manifestou as suas preferências em um testamento. \nAO VIVO: Acompanhe a repercussão da morte do papa\n✅ Clique aqui para seguir o canal de notícias internacionais do g1 no WhatsApp\nMas os elementos centrais permanecem, incluindo três momentos-chave que devem ser observados entre a morte de um papa e seu sepultamento. Veja mais abaixo cada um deles.\nEmbora os papas frequentemente façam ajustes nas regras que regulam o Conclave, uma revisão dos ritos funerários papais não era feita desde o ano 2000. As mudanças se tornaram necessárias após Francisco expressar seus próprios desejos.\nEm 2023, alguns meses depois da morte de Bento XVI, Francisco revelou que estava trabalhando com o mestre de cerimônias litúrgicas do Vaticano, o arcebispo Diego Ravelli, para reformular completamente o livro de ritos e simplificá-los.\nAo explicar as reformas, Ravelli afirmou que as mudanças tinham como objetivo “enfatizar ainda mais que o funeral do Pontífice Romano é o de um pastor e discípulo de Cristo, e não o de um homem poderoso deste mundo”.\nEnterro do papa\nArte/g1\nConfira a seguir as etapas do funeral do papa.\n1. Preparação do corpo\nPapa Francisco morre aos 88 anos\nVaticano\nOs ritos fúnebres ocorrem em três partes, chamadas de estações. A primeira ocorre na capela privada do papa, após profissionais de saúde confirmarem a morte. Até recentemente, essa etapa acontecia ao lado da cama do papa.\nApós o corpo repousar na capela, o cardeal que atua como camerlengo organizará o funeral. Ele também é responsável por administrar o Vaticano até que um novo papa seja eleito. O atual camerlengo é o cardeal Kevin Joseph Farrell, nomeado por Francisco em 2019.\nComo ocorre há séculos, o camerlengo chama formalmente o papa falecido pelo nome completo que recebeu no batismo — Jorge Mario Bergoglio. \nTradicionalmente, outro rito antigo também acontece após a declaração da morte do papa: a destruição do anel papal. Cada papa usa um anel feito sob medida com a imagem gravada de um homem pescando de um barco, uma referência ao evangelho de Mateus, onde Jesus chama São Pedro de “pescador de homens”. \nEsse Anel do Pescador, com o nome do papa gravado sobre a imagem, poderia ser usado como selo em documentos oficiais. O camerlengo quebrará o anel de Francisco e destruirá o selo com um martelo ou outro instrumento, para impedir que outra pessoa o use.\nOs aposentos papais também serão trancados, com entrada proibida — uma prática tradicional para evitar saques.\nLEIA TAMBÉM\nBEM-HUMORADO, FÃ DE FUTEBOL, 1º PAPA LATINO-AMERICANO: conheça a trajetória de Francisco\nDO FUNERAL AO CONCLAVE: quais são os próximos passos da Igreja Católica após a morte do papa Francisco\nSÉ VACANTE, CAMERLENGO E COLÉGIO DOS CARDEAIS: saiba quem comanda a Igreja Católica após a morte do papa Francisco\n2. Velório\nCardeal Giovani Battista benze o caixão de Bento XVI durante o funeral do papa emérito, em 5 de janeiro de 2023. \nGuglielmo Mangiapane/ Reuters\nO papa será vestido com sua simples batina branca e vestes vermelhas, e colocado em um caixão de madeira simples. Esse caixão será levado em procissão até a Basílica de São Pedro, onde ocorrerá a exposição pública do corpo pelos três dias seguintes. A expectativa é que o velório comece na quarta.\nDurante esse período, o corpo do papa ficará em um caixão simples e aberto, para enfatizar o papel humilde do papa como pastor, e não como chefe de Estado. Anteriormente, o corpo ficava sobre uma plataforma elevada chamada catafalco, prática encerrada no funeral do papa Bento XVI, feito em janeiro de 2023.\nBento XVI também foi o último papa a ser enterrado nos tradicionais três caixões — de cipreste, chumbo e olmo. Dois desses caixões continham documentos sobre seu pontificado; o primeiro também abrigava três sacos de moedas — ouro, prata e cobre — representando cada ano de seu pontificado.\nNo funeral de Francisco, após a exposição pública, um pano branco será colocado sobre seu rosto, enquanto ele repousa no caixão de carvalho — uma tradição que continua nos funerais papais. Mas esta será a primeira vez que apenas um único caixão será utilizado. Provavelmente, conterá um documento descrevendo seu pontificado e um saco de moedas referente ao seu tempo como papa.\nA Missa fúnebre será celebrada em São Pedro, provavelmente dentro da basílica, por causa do clima, e é provável que haja uma multidão de fiéis do lado de fora, reunidos na praça. \nA homilia refletirá sobre a vida e espiritualidade do papa falecido. O próprio Francisco fez a homilia no funeral de seu antecessor aposentado, o papa Bento XVI. \nJá Joseph Ratzinger, ainda antes de ser eleito papa Bento XVI, fez a homilia no funeral de João Paulo II. À época, Ratzinger era o líder — ou decano — de todos os altos membros da Igreja, o chamado Colégio dos Cardeais.\nO atual decano é o cardeal Giovanni Battista Re, de 91 anos, e não se sabe se ele conseguirá manter essa tradição devido à idade avançada. \nMissas continuarão sendo celebradas em memória de Francisco por nove dias após sua morte — um período chamado de Novendialis. Esse ritual foi inspirado em uma tradição romana antiga que previa um período de luto encerrado no nono dia após a morte.\nLEIA TAMBÉM\nVÍDEOS: brincadeiras, quebra de protocolos e a descontração do papa Francisco\nPULMÃO, INTESTINO E MAIS: os problemas de saúde enfrentados por Francisco\nMUITA CACHAÇA, POUCA ORAÇÃO: relembre piada do papa sobre brasileiros\n3. Sepultamento\nFachada da Basílica de Santa Maria Maggiore, onde papa Francisco será enterrado.\nDivulgação\nPapados anteriores foram sepultados em vários locais. Até a legalização do cristianismo no Império Romano, no início do século IV, os papas eram enterrados nas catacumbas, os cemitérios nos arredores de Roma.\nDepois disso, os papas passaram a ser enterrados em diferentes locais, como a Basílica de São João de Latrão — a catedral oficial de Roma — ou outras igrejas dentro e fora da cidade. Alguns chegaram a ser sepultados na França, durante o século XIV, quando o papado foi transferido para a fronteira francesa por razões políticas.\nA maioria dos papas é enterrada nas grutas sob a Basílica de São Pedro, e desde o sepultamento do papa Leão XIII em São João de Latrão, em 1903, todos os papas foram enterrados em São Pedro. \nNo entanto, segundo os desejos de Francisco, deverá haver uma procissão por Roma até Santa Maria Maggiore, com o carro funerário e outros veículos levando as pessoas que participarão desse ritual privado.\nApós algumas orações finais e a aspersão de água benta, o caixão será colocado em seu local definitivo dentro da igreja. Apenas mais tarde o espaço será aberto ao público para orações e veneração.\n*artigo produzido com informações de Joanne M.

Veja cardeais que têm nomes cotados\nCom a morte do papa Francisco nesta segunda-feira (21), o Vaticano vai começar os preparativos para escolher um novo líder da Igreja Católica. \nAté que isso ocorra, a Igreja terá uma espécie de governo temporário, e as decisões urgentes ficarão a cargo do Colégio dos Cardeais.\nA votação para eleger um novo papa, chamada de Conclave, deve começar entre 15 e 20 dias. Estão aptos a participar da eleição 135 cardeais com menos de 80 anos, membros do Colégio, sendo sete brasileiros. \nEntre os cotados para ser o novo papa há perfis diversos: cardeais mais progressistas, entre os quais aliados de Francisco, e também conservadores.\nAO VIVO: acompanhe a repercussão da morte do papa\nCAUSA DA MORTE: Papa Francisco morreu de AVC e insuficiência cardíaca, diz Vaticano\nPapa Francisco deixa legado de transformação na Igreja Católica\nVeja a seguir alguns nomes que estão sendo cotados para suceder Francisco. \nJean-Marc Aveline, arcebispo de Marselha, francês, 66 anos\nJean-Marc Aveline, arcebispo de Marselha, francês, 66 anos\nVaticano/Divulgação\nJean-Marc Aveline é conhecido em alguns círculos católicos como João XXIV, em referência à sua semelhança com o papa João XXIII, o papa reformador de rosto redondo do início dos anos 1960.\nAveline é conhecido por sua natureza simples e descontraída, sua facilidade para fazer piadas e sua proximidade ideológica com Francisco, especialmente em relação à imigração e às relações com o mundo muçulmano. \nEle também é um intelectual sério, com doutorado em teologia e graduação em filosofia.\nO arcebispo nasceu na Argélia em uma família de imigrantes espanhóis que se mudaram para a França após a independência da Argélia, e viveu a maior parte de sua vida em Marselha.\nSob o comando de Francisco, Aveline fez grandes progressos na carreira, tornando-se bispo em 2013, arcebispo em 2019 e cardeal três anos depois. Sua posição foi impulsionada em setembro de 2023, quando organizou uma conferência internacional da Igreja sobre questões mediterrâneas, na qual o papa Francisco foi o convidado principal.\nSe assumisse o cargo máximo, Aveline se tornaria o primeiro papa francês desde o século XIV, um período turbulento em que o papado se mudou para Avignon. Ele também seria o papa mais jovem desde João Paulo II. \nCardeal Peter Erdo, húngaro, 72 anos\nCardeal Peter Erdo, húngaro, 72 anos\nVatican News/Divulgação\nErdo já era um candidato papal no último conclave em 2013, graças aos seus amplos contatos com a Igreja na Europa e na África, e por ser visto como um pioneiro do movimento da Nova Evangelização para reacender a fé católica em nações avançadas secularizadas — uma prioridade para muitos cardeais.\nEle é considerado conservador em teologia e, em discursos por toda a Europa, enfatiza as raízes cristãs do continente. No entanto, também é visto como pragmático e nunca entrou em conflito abertamente com Francisco, ao contrário de outros clérigos de mentalidade tradicional.\nApesar disso, Erdo causou surpresa no Vaticano durante a crise migratória de 2015, quando foi contra o apelo do papa Francisco para que as igrejas acolhessem refugiados, dizendo que isso equivaleria a tráfico de pessoas — aparentemente se alinhando com o primeiro-ministro nacionalista da Hungria, Viktor Orban.\nEspecialista em direito canônico, Erdo teve uma trajetória acelerada durante toda a sua carreira, tornando-se bispo aos 40 anos e cardeal em 2003, quando tinha apenas 51 anos, o que o tornou o membro mais jovem do Colégio dos Cardeais até 2010.\nLEIA TAMBÉM: \nANÁLISE: papa Francisco eterniza legado de reforma e simplicidade na Igreja Católica\nBEM-HUMORADO, FÃ DE FUTEBOL, 1º PAPA LATINO-AMERICANO: conheça a trajetória de Francisco\nDO FUNERAL AO CONCLAVE: quais são os próximos passos da Igreja Católica após a morte do papa \nSÉ VACANTE, CAMERLENGO E COLÉGIO DOS CARDEAIS: saiba quem comanda a Igreja Católica após a morte de Francisco\nVÍDEOS: brincadeiras, quebra de protocolos e a descontração do papa\nPULMÃO, INTESTINO E MAIS: os problemas de saúde enfrentados por Francisco\nCardeal Mario Grech, secretário-geral do Sínodo dos Bispos, maltês, 68 anos\nCardeal Mario Grech, secretário-geral do Sínodo dos Bispos, maltês, 68 anos\nArquidiocese de Braga/Divulgação\nGrech vem de Gozo, uma pequena ilha que faz parte de Malta, o menor país da União Europeia. Partindo de um começo modesto, Grech evoluiu para grandes feitos, sendo nomeado pelo papa Francisco para ser secretário-geral do Sínodo dos Bispos — um cargo de peso dentro do Vaticano.\nInicialmente visto como conservador, Grech se tornou um porta-voz das reformas de Francisco dentro da Igreja durante anos, evoluindo rapidamente com os tempos.\nEm 2008, vários cidadãos gays malteses declararam que estavam deixando a Igreja em protesto contra o que viam como uma postura anti-LGBT do então pontífice, o Papa Bento XVI.\nGrech demonstrou pouca simpatia na época, mas, falando no Vaticano em 2014, ele pediu que a Igreja fosse mais receptiva aos seus membros LGBT e criativa para encontrar novas maneiras de abordar situações familiares contemporâneas.\nNo dia seguinte, o papa Francisco deu um tapinha em seu ombro durante o café da manhã e o elogiou pelo discurso, indicando-o para uma futura promoção.\nCardeal Juan Jose Omella, arcebispo de Barcelona, ​​espanhol, 79 anos\nCardeal Juan Jose Omella, arcebispo de Barcelona, ​​espanhol, 79 anos\nVatican News/Divulgação\nModesto e bem-humorado, Omella vive uma vida humilde apesar de seu título elevado, dedicando sua carreira na Igreja ao cuidado pastoral, à promoção da justiça social e à personificação de uma visão compassiva e inclusiva do catolicismo.\n\"Não devemos ver a realidade apenas pelos olhos daqueles que mais têm, mas também pelos olhos dos pobres\", disse ele ao site de notícias Crux em abril de 2022, em palavras que refletiam a visão de mundo de Francisco.\nNasceu em 1946 na vila de Cretas, no nordeste da Espanha. Após ser ordenado em 1970, serviu como padre em várias paróquias espanholas e também passou um ano como missionário no Zaire, hoje República Democrática do Congo.\nRessaltando sua dedicação a causas sociais, de 1999 a 2015 ele trabalhou em estreita colaboração com a instituição de caridade espanhola Manos Unidas, que combate a fome, as doenças e a pobreza nos países em desenvolvimento.\nEle se tornou bispo em 1996 e foi promovido a arcebispo de Barcelona em 2015. Apenas um ano depois, Francisco lhe deu um barrete cardinalício vermelho — uma atitude vista como um claro endosso às tendências progressistas de Omella, que contrastam com os elementos mais conservadores que antes dominavam a Igreja espanhola.\nCardeal Pietro Parolin, italiano, diplomata do Vaticano, 70 anos\nCardeal Pietro Parolin, italiano, diplomata do Vaticano, 70 anos\nVatican News/Divulgação\nFavorito dos apostadores, Parolin foi diplomata da Igreja durante a maior parte de sua vida e serviu como secretário de Estado do papa desde 2013, ano em que Francisco foi eleito.\nO cargo é semelhante ao de um primeiro-ministro, e os secretários de Estado são frequentemente chamados de \"vice-papas\" porque estão em segundo lugar, depois do pontífice, na hierarquia do Vaticano.\nParolin atuou anteriormente como vice-ministro das Relações Exteriores do Papa Bento XVI, que em 2009 o nomeou embaixador do Vaticano na Venezuela, onde defendeu a Igreja contra as iniciativas do então presidente Hugo Chávez para enfraquecê-la.\nEle também foi o principal arquiteto da reaproximação do Vaticano com a China e o Vietnã. Conservadores o atacaram por um acordo sobre a nomeação de bispos na China comunista. Ele defendeu o acordo, afirmando que, embora não fosse perfeito, evitou um cisma e proporcionou alguma forma de comunicação com o governo de Pequim.\nParolin nunca foi um ativista de linha de frente ou barulhento nas chamadas Guerras Culturais da Igreja, que se concentravam em questões como aborto e direitos gays, embora ele tenha condenado a legalização do casamento entre pessoas do mesmo sexo em muitos países como \"uma derrota para a humanidade\".\nCardeal Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle, filipino\nCardeal Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle, filipino\nVatican News/Divulgação\nTagle é frequentemente chamado de \"Francisco Asiático\" devido ao seu comprometimento semelhante com a justiça social e, se eleito, seria o primeiro pontífice da Ásia.\nNo papel, Tagle, que geralmente prefere ser chamado pelo apelido \"Chito\", parece ter todos os requisitos para ser um papa. \nEle tem décadas de experiência pastoral desde sua ordenação sacerdotal em 1982. Depois, adquiriu experiência administrativa, primeiro como bispo de Imus e depois como arcebispo de Manila.\nO Papa Bento XVI o nomeou cardeal em 2012. Em uma ação vista por alguns como uma estratégia de Francisco para dar a Tagle alguma experiência no Vaticano, o papa o transferiu de Manila em 2019 e o nomeou chefe do braço missionário da Igreja, formalmente conhecido como Dicastério para a Evangelização.\nEle vem do que alguns chamam de \"pulmão católico da Ásia\", já que as Filipinas têm a maior população católica da região. Sua mãe era filipina de origem chinesa. \nCardeal Joseph Tobin, arcebispo de Newark, NJ, americano, 72 anos\nCardeal Joseph Tobin, arcebispo de Newark, NJ, americano, 72 anos\nVaticano/Divulgação\nÉ improvável que os cardeais do mundo escolhessem o primeiro papa dos EUA, mas se estivessem dispostos a isso, Tobin pareceria a possibilidade mais provável.\nTobin serviu como segundo em comando de um escritório do Vaticano de 2009 a 2012 e foi então nomeado pelo Papa Bento XVI arcebispo de Indianápolis, Indiana. Francisco o promoveu a cardeal em 2016 e, posteriormente, o nomeou arcebispo de Newark.\nNesta última função, Tobin, um homem grandalhão conhecido por sua rotina de exercícios de levantamento de peso, lidou com um dos escândalos católicos de maior repercussão dos últimos anos. Em 2018, o então Cardeal Theodore McCarrick , um dos antecessores de Tobin em Newark, foi afastado do ministério por acusações de má conduta sexual com seminaristas.\nMcCarrick, que nega qualquer irregularidade, renunciou ao cargo de cardeal e mais tarde foi considerado culpado por um tribunal do Vaticano e removido do sacerdócio.\nTobin recebeu elogios por sua condução do escândalo, incluindo a decisão de tornar públicos acordos anteriormente confidenciais feitos entre a arquidiocese e as supostas vítimas de McCarrick.\nTobin é o mais velho de 13 irmãos e afirmou ser um alcoólatra em recuperação. Ele é conhecido por sua atitude de abertura em relação às pessoas LGBTQIA+, tendo escrito em 2017 que \"em muitas partes da nossa igreja, pessoas LGBTQIA+ foram levadas a se sentirem indesejadas, excluídas e até mesmo envergonhadas\".\nCardeal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson, ganês, funcionário do Vaticano, 76 anos\nCardeal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson, ganês, funcionário do Vaticano, 76 anos\nVatican News/Divulgação\nDe origens humildes em uma pequena cidade africana, o Cardeal Peter Turkson alcançou grandes feitos na Igreja, o que o tornou um candidato a se tornar o primeiro papa da África Subsaariana.\nEle combina uma longa experiência pastoral cuidando de congregações em Gana com experiência prática na liderança de vários escritórios do Vaticano, bem como fortes habilidades de comunicação.\nO fato de ele vir de uma das regiões mais dinâmicas para a Igreja, que está lutando contra as forças do secularismo em suas terras centrais europeias, também deve reforçar sua posição.\nQuarto filho de uma família de 10 filhos, Turkson nasceu em Wassaw Nsuta, na então chamada Costa do Ouro, no Império Britânico. Seu pai trabalhava em uma mina próxima e também era carpinteiro, enquanto sua mãe vendia vegetais no mercado.\nEle estudou em seminários em Gana e Nova York, foi ordenado em 1975 e depois lecionou em seu antigo seminário ganês e fez estudos bíblicos avançados em Roma.\nO papa João Paulo II o nomeou arcebispo de Cape Coast em 1992 e 11 anos depois o tornou o primeiro cardeal na história do estado da África Ocidental.\nAs promoções continuaram sob o sucessor de João Paulo II, Bento XVI, que o levou ao Vaticano em 2009 e o tornou chefe do Pontifício Conselho Justiça e Paz — o órgão que promove a justiça social, os direitos humanos e a paz mundial.\nNessa função, ele foi um dos conselheiros mais próximos do papa em questões como as mudanças climáticas e atraiu muita atenção ao participar de conferências como o fórum econômico de Davos.\nMatteo Maria Zuppi, italiano, arcebispo de Bolonha, 69 anos\nMatteo Maria Zuppi, italiano, arcebispo de Bolonha, 69 anos\nVatican News/Divulgação\nQuando Zuppi foi promovido em 2015 e se tornou arcebispo de Bolonha, a mídia nacional se referiu a ele como o \"Bergoglio italiano\", devido à sua afinidade com Francisco, o papa argentino que nasceu Jorge Mario Bergoglio.\nZuppi seria o primeiro papa italiano desde 1978.\nAssim como o papa Francisco quando morava em Buenos Aires, Zuppi é conhecido como um \"padre de rua\" que se concentra nos migrantes e nos pobres, e pouco se importa com pompa e protocolo. \nEle atende pelo nome de \"Padre Matteo\" e, em Bolonha, às vezes usa uma bicicleta em vez de um carro oficial.\nSe ele fosse eleito papa, os conservadores provavelmente o veriam com desconfiança. Vítimas de abuso sexual na Igreja também poderiam se opor a ele, já que a Igreja Católica Italiana, que ele lidera desde 2022, tem sido lenta em investigar e confrontar a questão.\nVÍDEOS: 9 vídeos que resumem o papado de Francisco",

Papa Francisco e cardeal João Braz de Aviz.\nVatican News\nO anúncio da morte do papa Francisco abalou profundamente a comunidade católica e gerou lamentações em todo o mundo. Jorge Mario Bergoglio, conhecido por seu carisma e pelas reformas que implementou na Igreja Católica, faleceu aos 88 anos nesta segunda-feira (21). \nSegundo o Vaticano, sua morte foi causada por um Acidente Vascular Cerebral (AVC), seguido por outras complicações (saiba mais abaixo).\nOs sinos da Basílica de São Pedro tocaram para marcar o momento, mas esse é apenas um dos muitos ritos que acompanham a despedida de um papa. \nA partir de agora, cerimônias cuidadosamente planejadas serão realizadas, e a Igreja Católica passará por eventos que decidirão o seu futuro, como o início do Conclave para eleger o sucessor de Francisco. \nO g1 reuniu 10 perguntas e respostas para ajudar você a entender os principais pontos sobre a morte do papa Francisco, as cerimônias e ritos que vão acontecer, o que vem pela frente e como será escolhida a nova liderança da Igreja Católica.\nAbaixo, descubra:\nQuando a morte foi anunciada? \nQuais as causas da morte? \nComo será o funeral?\nQuando será o sepultamento? \nComo Jorge  Bergoglio se tornou papa?\nConclave: como é a escolha do novo papa? \nQuem comanda a Igreja Católica agora?\nQuando será anunciado o novo papa? \nQuais os requisitos para ser papa? \nQuem são os candidatos ao papado? \n1. Quando a morte foi anunciada? \nJorge Mario Bergoglio faleceu aos 88 anos na madrugada desta segunda-feira, às 2h35 pelo horário de Brasília (7h35 no horário local). \nEle estava em seu apartamento na residência de Santa Marta, na Cidade do Vaticano, onde morava desde que foi eleito papa em 2013.\n\"O Bispo de Roma, Francisco, retornou à casa do Pai. Toda a sua vida foi dedicada ao serviço do Senhor e de Sua Igreja. Ele nos ensinou a viver os valores do Evangelho com fidelidade, coragem e amor universal, especialmente em favor dos mais pobres e marginalizados. Com imensa gratidão por seu exemplo como verdadeiro discípulo do Senhor Jesus, recomendamos a alma do Papa Francisco ao infinito amor misericordioso do Deus Trino\", dizia o comunicado oficial. \nOs sinos da Basílica de São Pedro, no Vaticano, tocaram para anunciar a notícia da morte. \n2. Quais as causas da morte? \nO papa morreu devido a um acidente vascular cerebral (AVC) seguido de insuficiência cardíaca, conforme informou o Vaticano. \nSegundo a certidão médica que atestou a morte, ele sofreu um AVC, entrou em coma e teve um colapso cardiocirculatório irreversível. \nO quadro foi agravado por uma série de problemas de saúde, incluindo uma insuficiência respiratória aguda causada por uma pneumonia multimicrobiana bilateral, bronquiectasias múltiplas, pressão alta e diabetes tipo II.\nInsuficiência cardíaca e AVC: entenda as causas da morte do papa Francisco\nA morte foi confirmada por um registro eletrocardiotanatográfico. Francisco estava se recuperando de uma pneumonia nos dois pulmões após ter ficado internado por 38 dias. Ele havia recebido alta há um mês e estava sob cuidados médicos.\nFrancisco foi hospitalizado pela primeira vez no início de fevereiro devido a problemas respiratórios. \nNo dia 14 de fevereiro, foi internado no hospital Agostino Gemelli para tratar uma bronquite. Mesmo hospitalizado, participou de algumas atividades religiosas, mas no dia 16 pediu desculpas por não poder participar da oração semanal na Praça de São Pedro.\nNo dia 17, o Vaticano informou que ele estava com uma infecção polimicrobiana. No dia seguinte, foi anunciado que ele tinha pneumonia bilateral. Francisco recebeu alta no dia 23 de março.\nPersonalidades e instituições lamentam morte de Papa Francisco\nDivulgação/Vaticano News\n3. Como será o funeral? \nO funeral do papa Francisco segue a \"Ordem das Exéquias do Sumo Pontífice\", que ele próprio aprovou em abril de 2024 e foi publicada em novembro. \nA primeira parte do funeral é a Missa de sufrágio, que tem como objetivo interceder pela alma dos mortos. Esta missa foi celebrada na Basílica de São João de Latrão, em Roma, pelo cardeal Baldo Reina na tarde desta segunda-feira.\nO corpo de Bergoglio passou por ritos de constatação da morte e deposição no caixão. O primeiro deles é a confirmação da morte, realizada pelo camerlengo - que é o cardeal responsável por administrar a Igreja durante o período de Sé Vacante. \nO camerlengo confirma a morte chamando o papa pelo nome três vezes. Após a confirmação, o \"Anel do Pescador\" é retirado e destruído, e o quarto do papa é selado. \nO corpo é colocado em um caixão de madeira revestido de zinco e levado para a Basílica de São Pedro, onde será velado na manhã desta quarta-feira (23). \nNa Basílica, o corpo será exposto diretamente no caixão, que será mais simples, feito de madeira revestida por zinco, ao invés dos três caixões tradicionais de cipreste, chumbo e carvalho.\n4. Quando será o sepultamento? \nEnterro do papa\nArte/g1\nDe acordo com as regras da Igreja Católica, o enterro do papa deve ocorrer entre quatro e seis dias após sua morte. \nDiferente de outros pontífices, Francisco pediu para ser sepultado na Basílica de Santa Maria Maggiore, em Roma, ao invés da tradicional Basílica de São Pedro. A última vez que um Papa foi enterrado fora da Basílica de São Pedro foi em 1903, com o papa Leão XIII.\nAlém disso, missas serão celebradas por nove dias consecutivos, seguindo a tradição dos \"novendiales\". Este é um período de luto e oração dedicado à alma do papa, durante o qual a Igreja e os fiéis rezam pela sua passagem para a vida eterna.\nAltar da Basílica de Santa Maria Maggiore, no centro de Roma, onde o papa Francisco será enterrado.\nAlberto Pizzoli/AFP\n5. Como Jorge  Bergoglio se tornou papa?\nBergoglio, que liderou a Igreja Católica por 12 anos, era conhecido por seu carisma e pelas reformas que implementou. Antes de se tornar papa, ele teve uma carreira diversificada: estudou química e trabalhou como professor.\nNascido em 17 de dezembro de 1936, em Buenos Aires, Francisco fez história ao ser o primeiro papa latino-americano. Ele também foi o primeiro pontífice da era moderna a assumir o papado após a renúncia de seu antecessor e o primeiro jesuíta a ocupar o cargo.\nFrancisco foi o 266º papa. Em 13 de março de 2013, durante o segundo dia do conclave para eleger o sucessor de Bento XVI,  Bergoglio foi escolhido como o novo líder da Igreja – mesmo contra sua própria vontade, como ele próprio admitiu.\nApesar de sua formação em Ciências Químicas e de ter sido professor de Literatura, Bergoglio, filho de imigrantes italianos, decidiu seguir a carreira religiosa e se dedicou aos estudos eclesiásticos.\nSeu perfil jovial e descontraído fez dele uma escolha popular entre os cardeais e uma opção ideal para a Igreja, que enfrentava um período de grandes desafios.\n6. Conclave: como é a escolha do novo papa? \nA escolha do novo líder da Igreja Católica começa entre 15 e 20 dias após a morte do papa. Durante esse período, o Vaticano convoca o Colégio dos Cardeais, que reúne religiosos de todo o mundo. Atualmente, esse grupo é composto por 252 cardeais, incluindo oito brasileiros.\nDesses cardeais, 135 têm menos de 80 anos e estão aptos a participar da eleição do novo papa, sendo sete deles brasileiros. Antes do início da votação, chamada de Conclave, o Colégio dos Cardeais participa de reuniões chamadas \"Congregações Gerais\", onde discutem e votam questões governamentais da Igreja.\nÉ através da Conclave que a Igreja Católica elege o novo papa. Durante os dias de eleição, os cardeais ficam isolados dentro do Vaticano, em uma área conhecida como \"zona de Conclave\", e fazem um juramento de segredo absoluto sobre o processo. Eles são proibidos de usar qualquer meio de comunicação com o exterior.\nAs votações ocorrem na famosa Capela Sistina. Para ser eleito, um cardeal precisa receber dois terços dos votos, que são secretos e queimados após a contagem. Até quatro votações podem ser realizadas diariamente.\nSe após três dias não houver um novo papa, uma pausa de 24 horas é feita para orações. Outra pausa pode ocorrer após mais sete votações sem um eleito. Se houver 34 votações sem consenso, os dois cardeais mais votados disputam um \"segundo turno\", ainda precisando de dois terços dos votos para ser eleito. Quando um cardeal é eleito, ele escolhe um nome e veste as vestes papais na \"Sala das Lágrimas\".\nCardeal coloca sua mitra durante a missa do início do conclave\nAndrew Medichini/AP\n7. Quem comanda a Igreja Católica agora?\nApós a morte do Papa, a administração do Vaticano é confiada ao camerlengo, que é responsável pelos bens e pelo Tesouro do Vaticano. \nAtualmente, esse cargo é ocupado pelo cardeal irlandês naturalizado norte-americano Kevin Joseph Farrell. O camerlengo tem a função de organizar a transição durante a Sé Vacante, o período em que a Igreja Católica fica sem um pontífice. Ele também foi responsável por confirmar a morte do papa e assume temporariamente o Palácio Apostólico, a residência oficial do papa.\nEnquanto o camerlengo mantém a autoridade administrativa, o Colégio dos Cardeais discute assuntos comuns ou urgentes da Igreja. No entanto, o Colégio dos Cardeais não pode fazer mudanças profundas na estrutura da Igreja, como alterar ou corrigir leis estabelecidas pelos papas.\nQuando o papa morre, quase todos os religiosos da cúpula do Vaticano deixam suas funções, incluindo o Cardeal Secretário de Estado e os responsáveis pelos Dicastérios da Cúria Romana. Permanecem em seus cargos: o camerlengo, o Penitenciário-Mor, o Cardeal Vigário-Geral para a Diocese de Roma, o Cardeal Arcipreste da Basílica do Vaticano, o Vigário-Geral para a Cidade do Vaticano e o Esmoleiro Apostólico. \n8. Quando será anunciado o novo papa? \nA duração do conclave pode variar bastante. Por exemplo, o conclave que elegeu o papa Francisco em 2013 durou apenas dois dias, enquanto o mais longo da história, realizado entre 1268 e 1271, durou 34 meses.\nPor isso, ainda não é possível saber exatamente quando a Igreja Católica anunciará seu novo líder. No entanto, é tradicional que o novo papa seja apresentado à multidão que aguarda na Praça de São Pedro, no Vaticano.\nO pontífice é apresentado diretamente da sacada da Basílica de São Pedro, onde é proclamada a famosa frase \"Habemus Papam\", que significa \"Temos um papa\".\nFoto divulgada pelo Vaticano mostra o Papa Francisco durante a mensagem pascal na galeria central da Basílica de São Pedro\nHandout / VATICAN MEDIA / AFP\n9. Quais os requisitos para ser papa? \nOficialmente, não há requisitos básicos para que uma pessoa seja eleita papa – basta que ela seja católica e tenha pleno uso da razão. No entanto, na prática, há muitos séculos o eleito sempre tem sido do Colégio de Cardeais, o grupo que emite os votos no conclave. Este grupo é restrito a cardeais com menos de 80 anos.\nOs cardeais são bispos e arcebispos nomeados pelo papa para auxiliar em questões religiosas. \nO conclave, que é o processo de eleição do novo papa, deve começar entre 15 e 20 dias após a morte do Papa. Desta vez, 135 cardeais estão aptos a participar da eleição, sendo sete deles brasileiros\n10. Quem são os candidatos ao papado? \nO número de cardeais com direito de voto está acima do limite estabelecido por Paulo VI, que era de 120. A maioria desses eleitores foi nomeada cardeal pelo papa Francisco, mas nem todos compartilham sua filosofia ou política.\nUm exemplo notável é o cardeal alemão Gerhard Ludwig Müller, um dos maiores críticos de Francisco, quase um inimigo. Outro exemplo é o cardeal Robert Sarah, da República da Guiné, na África Ocidental.\nEntre os principais candidatos ao papado está o brasileiro Sérgio da Rocha, arcebispo metropolitano da Bahia. Desde 2023, ele faz parte do grupo dos nove cardeais conselheiros escolhidos pelo papa. \nSérgio da Rocha é um grande apoiador das reformas de Francisco e está comprometido com o combate à homofobia e a inclusão de casais gays na Igreja.\nOutros fortes candidatos incluem:\nJean-Marc Aveline, arcebispo de Marselha, francês, 66 anos;\nCardeal Peter Erdo, húngaro, 72 anos;\nCardeal Mario Grech, secretário-geral do Sínodo dos Bispos, maltês, 68 anos;\nCardeal Juan Jose Omella, arcebispo de Barcelona, espanhol, 79 anos;\nCardeal Pietro Parolin, italiano, diplomata do Vaticano, 70 anos;\nCardeal Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle, filipino;\nCardeal Joseph Tobin, arcebispo de Newark, NJ, americano, 72 anos;\nCardeal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson, ganês, funcionário do Vaticano, 76 anos;\nMatteo Maria Zuppi, italiano, arcebispo de Bolonha, 69 anos.",

A viagem ao Brasil feita por Papa Francisco \nSegunda-feira, 22 de julho de 2013. Esse foi o dia em que o papa Francisco desembarcou no Rio de Janeiro trazendo afeto e humildade que marcaram sua visita.\nO Santo Padre escolheu um carro econômico e foi do Aeroporto do Galeão à Catedral Metropolitana com janelas abertas. No meio do caminho, uma falha na segurança aproximou o Papa do povo. O carro ficou preso em um engarrafamento e a comitiva permaneceu bloqueada por uma onda de amor e carinho.\nAntes de participar da Jornada Mundial da Juventude, no Rio de Janeiro, o Papa foi de helicóptero até a cidade de Aparecida, em São Paulo. Na Basílica, o maior templo católico do Brasil, celebrou sua primeira missa pública na América Latina, que foi acompanhada por mais de 12 mil fiéis.\nNo mesmo dia, ele voltou para o Rio de Janeiro ao Hospital São Francisco de Assis da Providência de Deus, onde inaugurou uma ala para o tratamento de dependentes químicos.\nMais de 500 mil fiéis vieram de várias partes do Brasil para ver Francisco. Naqueles seis dias de julho de 2013, Francisco deixou mensagens carregadas de esperança.\nFrancisco quebrou o protocolo para se aproximar da multidão.\nO Papa argentino retribuiu tudo pacientemente e com o bom humor que sempre foi sua marca registrada.\nEm 12 anos de pontificado, Francisco não voltou para sua cidade natal, mas no Rio ele teve um encontro especial com seus conterrâneos. Cerca de 30 mil argentinos foram até a Catedral Metropolitana e muitos se apertaram do lado de fora para vê-lo.\nNo Teatro Municipal, ele ouviu o discurso emocionado de um morador do Complexo da Maré. O encontro mudou a vida de Valmir.\nAlguns dos encontros mais esperados da Jornada estavam previstos para acontecer em Guaratiba, na Zona Oeste, mas as fortes chuvas transformaram a estrutura do Campus Fidei em um grande lamaçal. Os eventos foram transferidos para as areias de Copacabana, na Zona Sul.\nA Jornada reuniu mais de 3 milhões de fiéis e peregrinos diante de um altar montado na areia, superando assim o público que todos os anos participa do Réveillon.\nNo primeiro grande encontro com os fiéis, Francisco desceu do helicóptero no Forte de Copacabana e seguiu de papamóvel até o altar. Sua Santidade mais uma vez interagiu com as pessoas que estavam no caminho.\nFrancisco surpreendeu ao trocar presentes com um fiel no meio da rua. Ele não pensou duas vezes e entregou o solidéu - a peça usada pelo Santo Padre para cobrir a cabeça.\n\"A todos e a cada um, um abraço afetuoso. Bem-vindos à 28ª JMJ nesta cidade maravilhosa do Rio de Janeiro\", disse.\nJornada Mundial da Juventude, no Rio de Janeiro, que reuniu mais de 3 milhões de pessoas.\nJornal Nacional\nDurante a celebração da Missa de Acolhida, Francisco usou o tempo fechado para falar da fé. \"Sempre ouvi dizer que os cariocas não gostam de frio e chuva, mas vocês estão mostrando que a fé de vocês é maior que o frio e a chuva. Parabéns, vocês são verdadeiros guerreiros. Vejo em vocês a beleza do rosto jovem de Cristo e meu coração se enche de alegria\", disse.\nAs gêmeas, Yasmim e Sophia, tinham apenas 16 dias de vida quando foram abençoadas por Francisco.\nUm dos momentos de maior emoção aconteceu na visita à favela de Varginha, na Zona Norte do Rio. A comunidade se enfeitou para receber o Papa. Ele visitou a casa de uma família. Dona Glória Araújo lembra que fez de tudo para que ele pudesse abençoar a neta.\nEle também abençoou o altar da igreja da comunidade e ganhou das crianças uma faixa do seu time do coração: o San Lorenzo.\nNo dia seguinte, Francisco voltou a Copacabana e acompanhou ali a encenação da Via Sacra. Aproveitou para fazer um discurso contra a intolerância, o racismo e o sofrimento de vítimas da violência e da fome, e pediu coragem aos jovens para mudar o mundo.\nFrancisco usou a imagem do Cristo Redentor para dizer que não podemos ficar de braços cruzados e que é preciso abrir os braços.\nEm uma entrevista exclusiva ao jornalista Gerson Camarotti, falou sobre brasileiros e argentinos.\n“Eu me senti recebido com um afeto que desconhecia, de forma muito calorosa. O povo brasileiro tem um grande coração. Quanto à rivalidade, creio que já está totalmente superada, porque negociamos bem: o Papa é argentino e Deus é brasileiro”, disse.\nNa Missa de Encerramento, o Papa disse que transmitir a fé com alegria permite receber em troca mais alegria.\nNo Rio, Francisco deixou uma forte mensagem de esperança e um sorriso que ficará para sempre guardado no coração dos brasileiros.\nLEIA TAMBÉM",

Francisco viajou para mais de 65 países em 12 anos de pontificado\nMilhões de fiéis do mundo todo tiveram a oportunidade de ver e ouvir o Papa Francisco em pessoa, sem precisarem ir ao Vaticano.\nA escolha dos destinos nunca foi despretensiosa. Viagens papais são uma ferramenta poderosa de diplomacia e fortalecimento do alcance da Igreja Católica.\nO Papa Francisco gostava de mandar recados e chamar a atenção do mundo para crises e conflitos. E, por onde passou, atraiu multidões.\nFrancisco foi a mais de 65 países de cinco continentes em 12 anos. Foram 47 viagens internacionais.\nA primeira vez foi para o Rio de Janeiro, para a Jornada Mundial da Juventude. Francisco mostrou por que ficou conhecido como o Papa da simplicidade.\nA ida à Terra Santa, no segundo ano, revelou o talento diplomático que marcaria seu pontificado. Francisco visitou locais sagrados para muçulmanos, cristãos e judeus, e pediu que todas as religiões buscassem a paz. Começava aí o legado de defensor da tolerância religiosa.\nFrancisco foi a mais de 75 países de cinco continentes em 12 anos\nJornal Nacional\nAo lado do primeiro-ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, e do então presidente Shimon Peres, Francisco pediu que a solução de dois estados - um israelense e um palestino - não permanecesse um sonho.\nE chamou Shimon Peres e o presidente da Autoridade Palestina, Mahmoud Abbas, para visitarem juntos o Vaticano.\nO encontro histórico foi no mês seguinte, ao lado do Patriarca de Constantinopla, Bartolomeu I, que lidera parte dos cristãos ortodoxos.\nNo Sri Lanka, o líder da Igreja Católica participou de um grande encontro com budistas, muçulmanos e hindus.\nE nas Filipinas, Francisco bateu um recorde histórico de público num evento papal. Foram mais de seis milhões de pessoas.\nFrancisco foi um dos articuladores da retomada das relações diplomáticas entre os Estados Unidos e Cuba, congeladas desde a década de 1970. Depois da conquista, ele visitou os dois países, em 2015.\nEm Cuba, se reuniu com os irmãos Fidel e Raul Castro.\nSaindo de Cuba, o Papa foi para os Estados Unidos e esteve no memorial para as vítimas dos atentados terroristas de 11 de setembro de 2001. Discursou também na sede da ONU, em Manhattan. Já na capital Washington, fez história mais uma vez.\nDepois de visitar o presidente Barack Obama, se tornou o primeiro Papa a falar no Congresso americano. Entre os temas, defendeu o respeito aos imigrantes. Uma multidão acompanhou em telões, e ele foi aplaudido de pé.\nA primeira visita à África veio no terceiro ano de pontificado, com o objetivo de mostrar ao mundo a pobreza e as necessidades do povo africano. Francisco passou pelo Quênia e por Uganda.\nE nem a guerra civil entre milícias cristãs e muçulmanas o impediu de ir à República Centro-Africana. Nunca antes um Papa tinha ido a uma zona de guerra na era moderna.\nFrancisco também se tornou o primeiro líder da Igreja Católica a se reunir com o Patriarca da Igreja Ortodoxa Russa desde a separação dos dois ramos do cristianismo, quase mil anos antes.\nNa ilha grega de Lesbos, o Papa ofereceu asilo a três famílias de refugiados que voltaram no avião com ele para o Vaticano.\nA caminhada em silêncio absoluto pelo campo de concentração de Auschwitz está entre os momentos marcantes. É o local de extermínio de mais de um milhão de judeus durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial.\nE na passagem por Mianmar e Bangladesh, o Papa defendeu a minoria muçulmana rohingya, perseguida por nacionalistas budistas.\nPolêmicas marcaram algumas viagens. No Chile, em 2018, manifestantes foram às ruas contra a impunidade de padres pedófilos.\nO Papa pediu perdão pelos crimes que abalaram a Igreja do Chile. Falou que sentia dor e vergonha pelo dano irreparável causado a crianças.\nNo Peru, se reuniu com povos da Amazônia e fez uma defesa enfática do meio ambiente e dos direitos dos indígenas. Foi a sexta viagem à América Latina.\nMas Francisco nunca voltou à terra natal, Argentina, depois de eleito.\nNos Emirados Árabes Unidos, se tornou o primeiro chefe da Igreja Católica a pisar na Península Arábica, o berço da religião islâmica. Primeira vez também no Iraque.\nFrancisco conheceu a cidade de Ur, venerada como o local de nascimento de Abraão: pai do judaísmo, do cristianismo e do islamismo.\nNa cidade sagrada de Najaf, se encontrou com a maior autoridade islâmica xiita do Iraque: o aiatolá Al-Sistani.

Foi nomeado arcebispo de Manaus em 2019 pelo Papa Francisco. \n\"Tinha um carinho tão grande pela Amazônia, pelo pulmão da terra, mas especialmente pelos seus povos, e especialmente pelos povos originários.\"\nO presidente da CNBB e atual arcebispo de Porto Alegre, Dom Jaime Spengler, tem sessenta e quatro anos.

Veja favoritos a suceder o papa Francisco\nSe o Papa Francisco será sucedido por alguém a quem ele deu a púrpura de cardeal, é apenas uma possibilidade.\nAtualmente, o número de cardeais com direito de voto, ou seja, com menos de 80 anos de idade, está acima do limite estabelecido por Paulo VI, que era de 120 purpurados. O que vai exigir um quórum mais alto para a eleição do novo Papa.\nO Papa Francisco não criou um colégio só de gente que pensa como ele. Ao contrário, deu espaço para todas as tendências: progressista, conservadora, reformista e tradicionalista. Uma das reformas deste Papa foi mudar a geopolítica do colégio de cardeais. Por isso, esse conclave é considerado um dos mais indecifráveis de que se tem notícia.\nHá quem afirme que, pouco antes de ir para o hospital, o próprio Papa Francisco estivesse já trabalhando pelo seu sucessor.\nUm dos preferidos de Francisco pode representar uma surpresa no conclave: o cardeal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, patriarca latino de Jerusalém.\nFranciscano, é natural de Bérgamo. Dos seus quase 60 anos de idade, viveu mais de 30 na Terra Santa. Seria um Papa italiano, mas com um conhecimento único do Oriente Médio. É apreciado por israelenses e palestinos.\nO secretário de Estado do Vaticano, teoricamente, é sempre um papabile. Embora não tenha tantos casos na história dos pontificados. Pietro Parolin, veneziano, moderado, diplomata com grande capacidade de mediação, é reconhecido como de centro. A favor dele, além das suas qualidades, joga o peso do jubileu, quando o trono papal não pode ficar vazio por muito tempo. Parolin seria uma escolha de Cúria, rápida, para conquistar um consenso.\nSe a preferência for um Papa de linha pastoral e progressista, há outros nomes fortes como Matteo Zuppi, arcebispo de Bolonha e presidente da Conferência Episcopal Italiana. Também diplomata. Poderia se tornar o Francisco II. Zuppi agrada tanto às comunidades gays como às organizações religiosas em defesa da família.\nO brasileiro Sérgio da Rocha, arcebispo metropolitano da Bahia, também é citado em algumas listas. Desde 2023, ele está no grupo dos nove cardeais conselheiros, escolhidos pelo Papa. É um grande apoiador das mudanças de Francisco e comprometido com o combate à homofobia e com a inclusão de casais gays na Igreja.\nSe o colégio cardinalício quiser prosseguir no caminho das inovações e reformas, com uma visão mais aberta do mundo, é um forte candidato.\nConclave, para escolher sucessor de Papa Franscisco, é considerado um dos mais indecifráveis de que se tem notícia\nJornal Nacional\nUm cardeal conservador, e muito respeitado pelo Papa Francisco, o arcebispo de Budapeste, Péter Erdő, torna-se um nome forte. Viveu o comunismo e foi vítima de perseguição religiosa. Foi presidente da Conferência Episcopal Húngara e relator de vários sínodos. \nEm questões políticas como a imigração, contra a qual a Hungria vem lutando há alguns anos, Erdő transmitiu uma abordagem equilibrada, reconhecendo o direito de imigrar e a necessidade de integrar refugiados sem colocar em risco a estabilidade política.\nEntre os conservadores, um nome que vem crescendo, dentro e fora do clero africano: o cardeal congolês Fridolin Ambongo Besungu. Ambongo liderou a oposição ao documento da Igreja que autorizou a bênção aos casais homossexuais.\nDa Ásia, o filipino Luis Antonio Tagle, teólogo ilustre, aparece sempre em todas as listas há vários anos. Apreciado por Francisco e pelos conservadores da Cúria Romana. Figura discreta, neto de avô materno chinês. Um detalhe não sem importância, seria um bom nome para a Igreja mais universal criada por Francisco.\nOutros nomes cotados para Papa: o austríaco Christoph Schönborn, considerado um teólogo brilhante, próximo de Bento XVI, mas também um dos apoiadores do Papa Francisco. Defende o acolhimento aos divorciados que se casaram novamente e aos homossexuais. Rigoroso contra os casos de abuso sexual.\nJean-Marc Aveline, arcebispo de Marselha, cidade multiétnica e multirreligiosa. Seria o primeiro Papa francês desde a época do Papado de Avignon, mais de seis séculos depois. Francisco tinha uma forte ligação com Marselha pela boa convivência entre as religiões.\nHá muitas apostas de que o papado voltará para as mãos de um italiano.\nFala-se também de um cardeal espanhol, de Malta, da Holanda. Também do Canadá e um afro-americano.\nMas, para os favoritos, existe sempre aquela máxima vaticana repetida em cada conclave: quem entra papabile sai cardeal.\nLEIA TAMBÉM",

Francisco deixa um legado reformista depois de 12 anos de pontificado\nJorge Bergoglio teve doze anos de pontificado. Foi um período importantíssimo para a Igreja Católica pelos movimentos que o Papa argentino fez em direção a reformas. Francisco fez uma opção clara pelo ato de acolher, em vez de julgar.\nNaquele dia 13 de março de 2013, a escolha do primeiro Papa latino-americano causou um grande impacto. O argentino Jorge Mario Bergoglio derrotou, no conclave, candidatos italianos que pareciam favoritos, porque a Igreja precisava mudar. Tinha que deixar para trás os escândalos de corrupção, de carreirismo e de vazamento de informações, como o Vatileaks.\nO cardeal que vinha da longínqua periferia de Buenos Aires, pegava transporte público e voava em classe econômica, imediatamente respondeu ao chamado. \nPapa Francisco foi um dos mais populares da atualidade\nReprodução/TV Globo\nAo ouvir do amigo brasileiro, o cardeal Cláudio Hummes dizer \"não se esqueça dos pobres\", Bergoglio anunciou o seu nome de pontífice: \"Francisco\". Uma homenagem a São Francisco de Assis, o santo que abandonou uma vida de luxo para se dedicar aos pobres.\nIniciou assim o seu pontificado: combatendo alguns símbolos ostensivos de riqueza. O ouro da cruz, que ele passou a usar de latão. O anel de pescador, ele preferiu de metal prateado. O sumo pontífice rejeitou o imenso apartamento papal do Palácio Apostólico e foi morar na Casa Santa Marta, num quarto sóbrio e modesto.\nA sua revolução simbólica não demorou a ganhar concretude. O primeiro ato foi moralizar o Banco do Vaticano, fechando mais de duas mil contas. Depois de muitas tentativas, Francisco conseguiu dar transparência , com novas leis contra crimes financeiros. Mas substituir um Papa vivo não foi uma tarefa simples para o primeiro pontífice jesuíta da história.\nNa herança do antecessor, muitos documentos secretos. Francisco recebeu das mãos de Bento 16 caixas de papéis e pistas do que estava errado dentro dos muros. \nPapa Francisco gostava de estar entre o povo\nReprodução/TV Globo\nViagens do Papa\nPara a sua primeira viagem como Papa, ele escolheu Lampedusa. Na ilha siciliana chegavam milhares de imigrantes da Líbia, depois da travessia mortal no Mediterrâneo. Os refugiados se tornaram um dos temas mais sensíveis para Francisco. E ali ele falou pela primeira vez em globalização da indiferença.\nO Brasil foi o primeiro país destinado ao Papa argentino. Quatro meses depois da posse, ele saiu andando numa avenida carioca, assustando a segurança e inaugurando um estilo muito diferente para um líder da Igreja. Em Copacabana, rezou com três milhões na missa da Jornada Mundial da Juventude.\nNo voo de volta a Roma, ouvimos as palavras que determinariam um novo rumo ao pontificado. Quando perguntei sobre os gays dentro do Vaticano, Francisco respondeu: \"Quem sou eu para julgar?\". \nPor esta frase, até então inédita para um Papa, ele ganharia a simpatia de tantos e a oposição feroz dos mais conservadores.\nEm uma de suas primeiras viagens como Papa, Francisco veio ao Brasil\nReprodução/TV Globo\nMudanças na Igreja\nDez anos depois, Francisco aprovaria uma nova orientação: a bênção aos casais do mesmo sexo na Igreja. Outro motivo de ruptura com os tradicionalistas. A sua primeira exortação apostólica, Evangelii Gaudium, propunha uma nova evangelização e questionava o modelo da economia capitalista.\nVítima de forças econômicas internacionais, que não perdoaram o seu discurso social demais, Francisco começou a ser combatido também pelos conservadores em defesa da doutrina. \nA cada sínodo convocado por ele, os seus inimigos começaram a crescer, resistindo às experiências de inovação do Papa, como a comunhão aos divorciados que se casaram de novo.\nA conduta do Papa Francisco contra a pedofilia – nem sempre bem-sucedida – foi muito severa. E hoje as penas para os religiosos que cometem este crime são maiores. Cardeais e bispos não possuem mais os privilégios de antes. E o segredo pontifício foi abolido para casos de abuso sexual. O Papa encontrou vítimas e pediu perdão. Mas as organizações de vítimas esperavam mais.\nDenúncias de corrupção na administração da economia vaticana também atingiram colaboradores de Francisco, que foram afastados e condenados.\nNa política internacional, Francisco mediou crises mundiais importantes, como entre Cuba e os Estados Unidos de Barack Obama. Influenciou o acordo de paz entre o governo colombiano e as principais guerrilhas do país. As relações da Santa Sé com a China foram recuperadas em 2018. \nNa corajosa viagem ao Iraque, ele pregou a irmandade, contra o fundamentalismo. \"A hostilidade, o extremismo e a violência não nascem de uma alma religiosa.\"\nO Papa de Roma criou relações de amizade profundas com autoridades muçulmanas e hebraicas. \"As nossas diferenças não são um dano, um perigo, são uma riqueza.\" \nDeu passos importantes na unidade dos cristãos. Num dos seus grandes eventos, quatro papas estiveram presentes. Dois em espírito, na canonização de João Paulo II e João XXIII. Bento XVI ficou ao lado de Francisco.\nNos últimos anos do seu pontificado, conseguiu finalmente investir na reforma da Cúria – o governo da Igreja Católica. \nFrancisco dedicou mensagens de ternura, quase que diariamente, aos pobres e marginalizados. E isso, num pontificado, tem um peso.\nOs seus dramas pessoais foram vividos com discrição. A sua história argentina durante a ditadura, a sua ausência do país de origem. \nFrancisco era também um homem brincalhão, capaz de provocações como a pergunta que sempre fazia aos brasileiros: \"Quem é melhor: Pelé ou Maradona?  \nO Papa Francisco nunca teve medo de dizer o que pensava. Ele foi capaz de se tornar um interlocutor da sociedade moderna. Mas no seu íntimo, era mais missionário do que progressista. Por isso, de certa forma, desiludiu os que esperavam para a mulher um papel mais decisivo na Igreja. \nNas entrevistas que dava, havia sempre algo revelador da sua intimidade. E ele não teve pudor em confessar a sua psicoterapia. \n\"Durante os dias terríveis da ditadura argentina, quando tinha que levar pessoas na clandestinidade para sair do país, vivi situações nas quais não sabia o que fazer. Então fui encontrar uma senhora, uma psiquiatra, por seis meses, uma vez por semana. Estou convencido de que cada sacerdote deve conhecer a psicologia humana.\"\nSobre a sua morte, chegou a descrever como a imaginava. \"Como Papa ou emérito. E em Roma. Não voltarei à Argentina.\" Deixou uma carta de renúncia, caso a sua saúde o tivesse impedido de governar a Igreja Católica.\nElas não se tornaram sacerdotes no seu pontificado. Mas Francisco foi o primeiro Papa a admitir: \"Um dos grandes pecados que cometemos foi masculinizar a Igreja. E uma tarefa que vos peço, por favor, é desmasculinizá-la.\"\nEm 6 de janeiro deste ano, nomeou a primeira prefeita do Vaticano, irmã Simona Brambilla. No dia 20, escolheu outra religiosa como a primeira governadora da cidade-estado, Raffaella Petrini.\nProblemas de saúde\nO declínio físico, nos últimos quatro anos, não o desestimulou a continuar no comando. Na hospitalização em julho de 2021, Francisco teve um pedaço do intestino retirado por uma diverticulite. A sua presença agitou o Agostino Gemelli, conhecido como o hospital dos papas. \nMesmo convalescente, mostrou aquela qualidade de não conseguir ficar parado. Andou pelos corredores, visitou crianças com câncer e rezou o Angelus da janela do décimo andar.\n\"Aqui estão algumas crianças amigas doentes. Por que as crianças sofrem? 'Por que as crianças sofrem' é uma questão que toca o coração. Acompanhem-nas com a oração e rezem por todos os enfermos.\"\nOs efeitos da anestesia demoraram meses a passar. Por isso, em 2022, quando a dor crônica nos joelhos se tornou muito aguda, o Papa preferiu uma cadeira de rodas à cirurgia.\nTrabalho pela paz\nA sua campanha diplomática contra a guerra na Ucrânia comoveu os católicos, mas não os líderes das nações em guerra. Às ofertas de Francisco para mediar as negociações entre Vladimir Putin e Volodymyr Zelensky, no solo neutro do Vaticano, a resposta foi o silêncio. \nIncansável, o Papa continuou os seus apelos pela paz, dia após dia. Principalmente depois que explodiu a guerra entre Israel e o Hamas, após os ataques terroristas de 7 de outubro de 2023, que mataram 1,2 mil pessoas e fizeram 250 reféns.\nEm vários momentos, cresceu a tensão entre o chefe da Igreja Católica e o primeiro-ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. O Papa Francisco, além de lamentar a morte dos israelenses, denunciou inúmeras vezes a matança de milhares de crianças palestinas pelas armas de Israel.\n\"Oremos pelas vítimas, em especial, pelas crianças.\"\nFrancisco deixou legado\nNas liturgias, o pontífice argentino também deixou o seu rastro. Criou novas regras para as missas em latim, retomadas pelo antecessor. E as missas modernas, dos anos de 1970, pós-Concílio Vaticano II, não poderão mais ser esquecidas.\nEm 2020, como líder espiritual, em plena pandemia de covid, Francisco obteve ainda mais consenso popular. As suas orações comoveram o mundo assustado e carente de afeto. A sua imagem solitária, na Praça São Pedro deserta, andando com dificuldade, provavelmente ficará para sempre na história dos pontificados.",

Segundo o Vaticano, a morte foi causada por um acidente vascular cerebral (AVC) e insuficiência cardíaca.\n\nEstas são as últimas imagens do Papa Francisco vivo, no papamóvel, na Praça São Pedro.\nUm dia antes, o Papa cumprimentou os fiéis, desejando boa Páscoa.\nA última mensagem, que foi lida pelo Monsenhor Diego Ravelli, será lembrada porque resume toda a essência do seu pontificado – um pedido de paz.\nPapa Francisco morreu aos 88 anos\nReprodução/TV Globo\nOs últimos momentos do Papa no modesto apartamento da Casa Santa Marta foram reconstruídos por fontes vaticanas. Ele acordou às seis da manhã, e os colaboradores o encontraram bem, embora seu estado geral já estivesse seriamente comprometido há dias, inclusive o coração.\nPouco depois, por volta das 7 horas, duas da manhã no horário de Brasília, o Papa se sentiu mal. Foi imediatamente assistido pela equipe médica presente no Vaticano. Às sete e trinta e cinco, Francisco parou de respirar.\nA causa da morte foi um derrame cerebral seguido de parada cardíaca. Os médicos comentaram que ele morreu serenamente.\nÀs nove e quarenta e sete, o camerlengo, o camareiro da Igreja, Cardeal Kevin Farrell, deu a notícia:\n\"Queridos irmãos e irmãs, é com profunda tristeza que devo anunciar o falecimento do nosso Santo Padre Francisco. Às 7h35 desta manhã, o Bispo de Roma, Francisco, retornou à casa do Pai. Toda a sua vida foi dedicada ao serviço do Senhor e da sua Igreja. Ele nos ensinou a viver os valores do Evangelho com fidelidade, coragem e amor universal, especialmente em favor dos mais pobres e marginalizados. Com imensa gratidão por seu exemplo como verdadeiro discípulo do Senhor Jesus, encomendamos a alma do Papa Francisco ao infinito amor misericordioso do Deus Uno e Trino.\"\nCarmelengo Kevin Farrell anuncia a morte do Papa Francisco\nReprodução/TV Globo\nA morte pegou de surpresa o Vaticano, apesar da fragilidade da saúde dele nos últimos meses. No dia quatorze de fevereiro, ele foi hospitalizado com uma bronquite. A crise respiratória se tornou uma pneumonia, e Francisco precisou de equipamentos para ajudar na respiração. Foram quarenta dias no Hospital Gemelli. Quando recebeu alta, os médicos disseram que levaria muito tempo para que ele estivesse totalmente recuperado.\nMas o Papa não desistia de estar próximo dos fiéis e participou como pôde das celebrações de Páscoa.\nFuneral de Francisco\nO corpo de Francisco foi levado para a Capela Santa Marta e seguirá para a Basílica de São Pedro, na quarta-feira (23).\nFrancisco mudou as regras dos funerais papais e o corpo dele deverá ser enterrado fora dos muros vaticanos.

O pontífice ficou conhecido pelo perfil carismático e pelas reformas que promoveu na Igreja Católica.\nAo longo da carreira, antes de ser papa, o argentino também estudou química e trabalhou como professor. Nascido em 17 de dezembro de 1936, em Buenos Aires, Francisco foi o primeiro papa latino-americano da história.\nEle também foi o primeiro pontífice da era moderna a assumir o papado após a renúncia de seu antecessor e, ainda, o primeiro jesuíta no posto.\nFrancisco foi o papa número 266. Em 13 de março de 2013, durante o segundo dia do conclave para eleger o substituto de Bento XVI, Bergoglio foi escolhido como o novo líder – inclusive contra sua própria vontade, segundo ele mesmo admitiu.\nMas a carreira no catolicismo foi uma escolha própria do argentino. Formado em Ciências Químicas e professor de Literatura, o religioso, filho de imigrantes italianos, acabou se dedicando aos estudos eclesiásticos.\nO perfil jovial e descontraído do religioso fez com que ele se tornasse uma opção popular entre os colegas cardeais e uma escolha ideal para a Igreja, que vivia um de seus momentos mais delicados.\nVeja mais notícias da região no g1 Ribeirão Preto e Franca\nVÍDEOS: Tudo sobre Ribeirão Preto e região",

Morador de Nova Friburgo relembra participação na JMJ de 2013\nA notícia da morte do papa Francisco na madrugada desta segunda-feira (21) reacendeu memórias de um encontro emocionante que mudou a vida de John Mascouto, morador de Nova Friburgo, na Região Serrana do Rio. Ele teve participação ativa na Jornada Mundial da Juventude (JMJ) Rio 2013, quando tinha 28 anos, e conseguiu não só ver o papa, mas tocá-lo.\nNa ocasião, o pontífice, recém-eleito, estava na primeira viagem apostólica e fazia um dos trajetos dentro de um carro. O toque no papa ocorreu durante a vigília em Copacabana, que reuniu 3,7 milhões de pessoas. Foi um momento rápido, mas com significado profundo para John (veja no vídeo acima).\n“Era tanta gente querendo tocar o Santo Padre... e eu consegui! Foi um momento de grande emoção, no meio de jovens do mundo inteiro, todos falando línguas diferentes. Foi ali que caiu a ficha: estávamos diante de um verdadeiro sucessor de Pedro\", lembrou.\nJohn Mascouto, de Nova Friburgo, contou sobre a emoção de tocar no papa Francisco no RJ em 2013\nArquivo pessoal/John Mascouto\nJohn contou ao g1 que viveu intensamente os bastidores e os dias do evento, e que correu atrás de cada aparição do Papa: na Quinta da Boa Vista, na Lapa e em Copacabana. \nVaticano anuncia que papa Francisco morreu por AVC e insuficiência cardíaca\nSaiba como será o funeral e o sepultamento do papa Francisco\nDe um página no Facebook à organização da JMJ\nTudo começou em 2010, quando o então Papa Bento XVI anunciou que a próxima edição da JMJ seria realizada no Brasil. Entusiasmado, John criou uma página não oficial no Facebook dedicada ao evento. O projeto viralizou, reunindo milhares de seguidores, tornando-se um dos principais canais de divulgação da Jornada entre jovens católicos brasileiros e estrangeiros.\nO engajamento digital abriu portas para que ele se envolvesse diretamente na organização da JMJ, vivenciando de perto os preparativos até a chegada do Papa Francisco, que assumiu o pontificado após a renúncia de Bento XVI, em 2013.\nUma conexão cultural e espiritual\nA eleição do papa Francisco, o primeiro pontífice latino-americano da história, fortaleceu o sentimento de proximidade. \n“O fato de ele ser argentino fazia a gente se sentir ainda mais conectado”, relembra John.\nEssa conexão ganhou forma na pré-Jornada, quando a Paróquia Santa Teresinha, em Conselheiro Paulino, em Nova Friburgo, acolheu 60 peregrinos argentinos.\n“Eles chegaram e a gente foi organizando: esse vai para a casa do fulano, aquele para a casa do cicrano... Era uma troca cultural riquíssima”, diz John.\nO legado de Francisco: uma igreja \"para todos\" \nA experiência com o Papa argentino transformou a percepção de John sobre o papel da Igreja e de seu líder máximo.\n“O ensinamento que mais carrego é o que ele repetia: ‘A Igreja é para todos. Todos, todos, todos.’ Ele abriu as portas, tirou a igreja das sacristias e colocou-a no meio do povo”, afirma.\nCom voz embargada, John lembra que, mesmo em seus últimos momentos, o Papa Francisco deixou uma última bênção de Páscoa para os fiéis.\n“Ele celebrou a última Páscoa com a gente e fez sua passagem. Foi a sua própria Páscoa\".\nLuto e esperança pelo futuro\nSobre o momento atual da Igreja após a morte do pontífice, John, hoje com 40 anos, acredita que é tempo de recolhimento e oração. \n“Agora a Igreja vive o luto. Depois vem o conclave, a escolha do novo Papa. Mas a gente confia: Deus já sabe quem será o próximo sucessor\".\nCom a voz firme, ele finaliza:\n“Dez anos depois daquele encontro, o que fica é a certeza de que o Papa Francisco mudou a Igreja — e mudou a gente. Foi um Papa de sorriso largo, de fala simples, de acolhida verdadeira. E isso ninguém vai esquecer\".\nTrês milhões de fiéis acompanham missa do papa em Copacabana neste domingo (28)",

Isso é fidelidade a Jesus, que ama e nos perdoa”, disse o arcebispo.\nAlém da Catedral da Sé, missas também foram realizadas nas paróquias Mãe Divina Providência, Perpétuo Socorro e Boa Viagem, assim como nas paróquias Divino Espírito Santo e Santíssima Trindade.\nNesta terça-feira (22), será celebrada outra missa na Nossa Senhora Aparecida da Foz do Rio Anil, no Cohafuma, às 7h da manhã e na Paróquia São Maximiliano, no Vinhais, às 19h.

É uma dificuldade tremenda não ter o direito de escolher quem vai comandar a ilha”, falou.\nJá o arquiteto e morador da ilha João Rocha afirmou que a população quer ter o direito ao voto. “Nós temos amadurecimento político, não é possível seguir sem direito ao voto, precisamos ter a opção de escolher e até errar, se for o caso, e votar novamente e tentar acertar”.\nA empresária Natália Veríssimo da Costa disse que o objetivo do movimento é reforçar a necessidade de mudança no sistema de gestão. “Nos lutamos por democracia, Noronha é o único do Brasil que não elege o gestor. Vivemos como o regime monárquico.

Inclusive, as imagens mostram dois homens instalando os equipamentos de aço para barrar a enchente, por volta das 19h55 de sábado. \nA força da água, causada por dois carros que passaram na rua alagada, derrubou a contenção e quebrou o portão, invadindo a garagem subsolo e o elevador do prédio. Às 20h20, o alagamento já estava na metade das rodas dos carros estacionados. \n\"A gente ficou assustado, claro. Muita gente tem medo do fogo, mas a água também é muito rápida\", comentou Simone. \"A velocidade da água estava muito forte. Não tinha o que fazer, aí [começou] a correria para tirar os carros e colocá-los para a garagem de cima\", acrescentou. \nForça-tarefa \nNo vídeo, ainda é possível ver a força-tarefa organizada pelos moradores para retirar os veículos de dentro da garagem. Segundo Simone, os residentes mais antigos, que passaram pelo alagamento de 2020, conseguiram montar a logística para que a situação fosse resolvida com segurança.\nComportas não suportam a força da água durante temporal em Santos, SP\nReprodução\n\"Tinha gente operada, que não podia tirar o carro, aí o outro [morador] tirou. A gente fez uma força-tarefa dentro do que estava possível para gente salvar o máximo de carros. Graças a Deus ficou todo mundo bem e não tinha ninguém dentro do elevador\", afirmou a administradora. \nAinda de acordo com Simone, o carro de um morador que estava viajando e algumas motos acabaram ficando dentro da garagem. Além disso, um outro veículo não conseguiu subir até a rua e ficou na rampa para proteger o motor.   \nO g1 não localizou a administração do edifício até a última atualização desta reportagem. \nTemporal em Santos \nTemporal alaga avenida da praia de Santos (SP)\nRedes Sociais\nA Defesa Civil informou que a cidade esteve entre os municípios que registraram maior acumulado do estado em um período de 24 horas. Vídeos mostram que diversos trechos de Santos ficaram alagados, incluindo a avenida da praia. \nAté quem estava abrigado no Praiamar Shopping, no bairro Aparecida, sofreu os impactos da chuva. Isso porque a água invadiu o local após uma infiltração na cúpula, que causou um vazamento. \nSegundo a assessoria de imprensa do centro comercial, a área atingida foi isolada e as equipes trabalharam para minimizar os transtornos.\nVÍDEOS: g1 em 1 minuto Santos",

A viagem ainda não tem data confirmada, dependendo do protocolo do Vaticano, segundo a Secretaria de Comunicação Social da Presidência (Secom). \nLula e Janja se encontraram com o papa Francisco por algumas vezes. Eles trataram da guerra da Rússica contra a Ucrânia,  o combate à fome e sobre as mudanças climáticas (leia mais aqui). Lula e Janja também realizaram uma missa pela saúde do papa no Palácio da Alvorada, residência oficial da Presidência.\nLula fala sobre paixão do papa Francisco pelo futebol: 'O mais brasileiro dos argentinos'\nJorge Mario Bergoglio morreu aos 88 anos às 7h35 desta segunda no horário do Vaticano (2h35, no horário de Brasília).

Em 13 de março de 2013, durante o segundo dia do conclave para eleger o substituto de Bento XVI, Bergoglio foi escolhido como o novo líder – inclusive contra a sua própria vontade, segundo ele mesmo admitiu.\nLula também decretou luto oficial de sete dias no Brasil pela morte do papa Francisco na manhã desta segunda. Por volta das 10h, as bandeiras em frente ao Palácio do Planalto e ao Supremo Tribunal Federal já eram hasteadas a meio-mastro – símbolo do luto nos prédios públicos.\n\"É declarado luto oficial em todo o País, pelo período de sete dias, contado da data de publicação deste Decreto, em sinal de pesar pelo falecimento de Jorge Mario Bergoglio, Sua Santidade o Papa Francisco, a quem serão tributadas honras fúnebres de Chefe de Estado\", diz o decreto de luto publicado no \"Diário Oficial da União\".\n\"Francisco foi o papa do acolhimento e por isso acordamos hoje um pouco orfãos do seu afeto. Um afeto que era livre de preconceitos e julgamentos. Em um mundo que sofre com a discriminação e a insegurança. Para francisco, somos todos irmãos criados para amarmos uns aos outros. Por sermos todos irmãos, não há razão para tanta discórdia, tanto ódio, tantas guerras e tanta desigualdade no mundo. Francisco foi o papa de todos, mas principalmente dos excluídos, dos mais pobres, dos injustiçados, dos imigrantes, dos que não tem voz, das vítimas do abandono e da fome\", afirmou Lula em um vídeo divulgado pela Presidência da República na noite desta segunda.\nLula e Janja irão ao funeral do papa Francisco em Roma, informa Planalto\n\"Papa Francisco foi o papa da paz, do diálogo, da união e do amor a todas as formas de vida. Fez seguidos alertas sobre a crise climática a ameaça de distribuição do nosso planeta – obra prima da criação divina. Condenou todas as guerras, que tem como vítimas preferenciais a população civil - sobretudo mulheres e crianças\", continuou Lula.\n\"Na sua bênção de despedida no domingo de páscoa, pediu para voltarmos a ter esperança de que a paz é possível. Francisco foi o papa da esperança. Em sua despedida, renovou a crença nos seres humanos e previu o futuro melhor para a humanidade. Disse que o amor venceu o ódio, a verdade venceu a mentira, o perdão venceu a vingança. Isso é o mundo que haveremos de construir inspirados no papa Francisco. Se formos capazes de cultivar a paz, o amor a justiça e a fraternidade. Que Deus abençoe a humanidade\", concluiu o presidente.\nRelação de Lula com papa Francisco\nLula se reuniu com o papa Francisco por algumas vezes. Em 2020, antes de ser candidato ao terceiro mandato como presidente, Lula e Francisco abordaram temas como fome, desigualdade social e intolerância na conversa com o pontífice.\nEm 2023, já como presidente, Lula se reuniu com o papa ao lado da primeira-dama Janja da Silva. Eles discutiram temas como a guerra na Ucrânia, mudanças climáticas e combate à fome. \nNo ano seguinte, os dois voltaram a se reunir durante visita de Lula à Itália para a cúpula do G7. Lula, mais uma vez acompanhado da primeira-dama Janja, discutiu com Francisco temas como paz mundial, combate à fome e redução das desigualdades. Ele também expressou o desejo de convidar o pontífice para a COP 30 em Belém, em 2025. \nA primeira-dama Janja da Silva também se encontrou com o papa Francisco no Vaticano em fevereiro. Durante a visita, o pontífice perguntou sobre a saúde do presidente Lula e expressou seu apoio à Aliança Global Contra a Fome e a Pobreza, uma iniciativa do governo brasileiro. \nEm uma rede social, Janja mencionou estar muito emocionada e agradeceu pelas orações do papa pela recuperação de Lula. \nDuas semanas depois, Lula e Janja realizaram uma missa na capela do Palácio da Alvorada pela saúde do papa Francisco, que à época, estava internado para tratar uma dupla pneumonia. A missa foi conduzida por três padres jesuítas e contou com a presença de Dom Raymundo Damasceno, Cardeal e Arcebispo Emérito de Aparecida.",

É muita cachaça e pouca oração'. O diálogo voltou a viralizar nas redes sociais após a morte de Francisco. Padre que ouviu brincadeira do papa Francisco sobre brasileiros relembra encontro\nO padre João Paulo Souto Victor, de Cuité, na Paraíba, relembrou um momento divertido com o papa Francisco, conhecido por seu carisma e espontaneidade. Ao pedir uma bênção para seus conterrâneos, o padre foi surpreendido com uma brincadeira do pontífice. Piada foi relembrada nesta segunda-feira (21), após a morte de Francisco, aos 88 anos.\nEm maio de 2021, enquanto caminhava pelo pátio de San Damaso, no Vaticano, o papa foi abordado por João Paulo, que pediu orações pelos brasileiros: “Santo Padre, reze por nós, brasileiros”. Sorrindo, Francisco respondeu com bom humor: “Vocês não têm salvação. É muita cachaça e pouca oração”. Assista o momento:\nPapa faz piada sobre brasileiros: 'Não têm salvação. É muita cachaça e pouca oração\"\nApós receber a notícia da morte do pontífice, João Paulo destacou a importância de relembrar os momentos de afeto deixados por Francisco. Na época, o vídeo foi publicado nas redes sociais e gerou uma enorme repercussão — inclusive com comentários negativos sobre a fala do papa.\n\"Como é bom olhar para trás e lembrar, ao longo destes 12 anos de pontificado, os momentos humanos e afetivos do papa, que deixa marcas tão humanas e tão simples na vida de cada um de nós. O papa brincava. Claro que estas ações de Francisco sempre vão repercutir. O papa Francisco deixa um legado de um papa humano, de um papa próximo do povo, de um papa audacioso no ponto de vista da coragem da reforma da Igreja\", destaca o padre João Paulo. \nO padre João Paulo relembrou que o encontro ocorreu quando estudava em Roma. Ele estava acompanhado de outro sacerdote, que registrou o momento em vídeo. \nSegundo ele, aquele instante permanece guardado em seu coração. Embora seja um momento de sofrimento para os cristãos, o padre ressaltou a importância da missão cumprida pelo papa.\n“Guardo no meu coração aquele rosto sereno, aquele olhar vibrante, mãos macias, mas que transmitem uma paz muito grande para nós, enquanto Igreja Cristã. Então, este dia é um dia de sofrimento, mas um dia de alegria, no sentido de que nós cremos na vida eterna e sabemos que o santo padre, papa Francisco, cumpriu a sua missão de trazer esperança para nossas vidas em tempos difíceis, em tempos de turbulência”, afirmou o padre João Paulo.\nPapa Francisco e padre João Paulo Souto Victor\nArquivo pessoal\nO padre João Paulo afirmou ainda que a Igreja Católica enfrentará o desafio de escolher um novo papa e espera que o sucessor dê continuidade ao legado de Francisco.\n“Estamos diante de um desafio, mas também de um tempo novo de esperança; que aquele que venha a substituí-lo seja capaz de dar continuidade ao legado que ele semeou entre nós: o legado da humildade, da simplicidade, mas, acima de tudo, da proximidade”, refletiu o padre.\nPapa Francisco morre aos 88 anos\nVisita do Papa Francisco ao Brasil\nReprodução/TV Vanguarda\nJorge Mario Bergoglio, o papa Francisco, morreu aos 88 anos às 2h35 pelo horário de Brasília, 7h35 pelo horário local, desta segunda-feira (21). As informações foram confirmadas pelo Vaticano. O pontífice ocupou o cargo máximo da Igreja Católica por 12 anos.\n\"O Bispo de Roma, Francisco, retornou à casa do Pai. Toda a sua vida foi dedicada ao serviço do Senhor e de Sua Igreja. Ele nos ensinou a viver os valores do Evangelho com fidelidade, coragem e amor universal, especialmente em favor dos mais pobres e marginalizados. Com imensa gratidão por seu exemplo como verdadeiro discípulo do Senhor Jesus, recomendamos a alma do Papa Francisco ao infinito amor misericordioso do Deus Trino\", diz comunicado oficial.\nFrancisco se recuperava de uma pneumonia nos dois pulmões após ficar internado por cerca de 40 dias.\nNascido em 17 de dezembro de 1936 em Buenos Aires, na Argentina, Francisco foi o primeiro papa latino-americano da história. Ele também foi o primeiro pontífice da era moderna a assumir o papado após a renúncia do seu antecessor e, ainda, o primeiro jesuíta no posto.\nÀ frente da Igreja Católica por quase 12 anos, Francisco foi o papa número 266.

Daniel Lima com o papa Francisco durante o Sínodo da Amazônia, em 2019.\nArquivo pessoal\nUm dos momentos mais marcantes da trajetória de fé e da vida de Daniel Lima, assessor do Conselho Indigenista Missionário (Cimi) e morador de Lábrea, foi o encontro com o papa Francisco durante o Sínodo da Amazônia, em 2019, no Vaticano.\nEm entrevista ao g1, o missionário relembra o impacto do pontífice na defesa dos povos tradicionais e pela preservação da Amazônia. Francisco, que morreu nesta segunda-feira (21), aos 88 anos, vítima de um Acidente Vascular Cerebral (AVC) seguido de falência cardíaca, deixou um legado de acolhimento e valorização dos povos originários.\n\"Francisco sempre colocou os povos originários no centro das discussões\", afirma Daniel, que teve a oportunidade de se encontrar com o pontífice durante o Sínodo da Amazônia, em 2019. \nLima relembrou com carinho o momento histórico em que teve a chance de representar os povos da Amazônia e debater diretamente com líderes religiosos e indígenas sobre questões essenciais para a região. Para ele, a morte de Francisco marca o fim de um pontificado que, por meio de gestos simbólicos e ações concretas, levou a voz dos povos da floresta até o Vaticano.\nDurante seu pontificado, o papa Francisco teve um forte compromisso com a Amazônia, destacando a importância do bioma para o planeta. Em outubro de 2019, ele convocou um Sínodo especial para discutir os desafios enfrentados pela região e a evangelização. \nO evento reuniu bispos e representantes de toda a Pan-Amazônia e se tornou um dos momentos mais importantes de seu papado, com foco na defesa do meio ambiente e dos povos tradicionais.\n📲 Participe do canal do g1 AM no WhatsApp\nAssessor do Cimi, entidade ligada à Conferência Nacional dos Bispos do Brasil (CNBB), Daniel descreve o encontro com o papa como um marco importante para a Igreja e para os povos da Amazônia. Durante o Sínodo, Francisco se mostrou acessível e atento às preocupações dos líderes indígenas e comunidades tradicionais. \n\"Foi um momento histórico para a Igreja na Amazônia e também para os povos tradicionais. Estavam ali bispos, lideranças indígenas, quilombolas e representantes de comunidades de toda a Pan-Amazônia\", lembrou Daniel.\nPapa Francisco conversa missionário durante o Sínodo da Amazônia, em 2019\nArquivo pessoal\nO missionário também destacou com carinho a convivência com Francisco, que se mostrou acessível e simples durante todo o evento. \n\"Ele se aproximava das rodas de conversa, conversava com todos, tratava todos como iguais. Ele transformou o mundo numa paróquia, cuidando de todos como um pai cuida da família\", disse.\nA conversa entre Daniel e o papa aconteceu logo nos primeiros dias do Sínodo. Segundo o missionário, um dos temas foi a presença feminina na Igreja, com destaque para Maria Madalena, a quem o papa reconheceu como símbolo de protagonismo e fé.\nOutro assunto lembrado foi a escolha de Francisco em manter a cruz simples que usava antes de se tornar papa, como sinal de humildade e proximidade com o povo.\n\"Ele poderia ter escolhido uma cruz de ouro, mas manteve a que já usava como bispo. Quando perguntaram o motivo, ele respondeu com algo que me marcou muito: que o pastor precisa ter cheiro de ovelha — e ele realmente vivia isso\", relembrou o missionário. \nLEIA TAMBÉM: \nArcebispo de Manaus está entre os brasileiros que vão participar do Conclave\nPapa vestiu roupas confeccionadas por amazonense durante cerimônia no Vaticano; relembre o momento\nFrancisco: o papa que olhou para a Amazônia e seus ribeirinhos\nCatólico e admirador do pontífice desde o início do pontificado, Daniel diz que viver essa experiência foi “quase inarrável”.\n“Desde 2013, quando ele foi eleito, eu já acompanhava com admiração. Quando escolheu o nome Francisco, pensei: vai ser um pontificado diferente. E foi. Ele se inspirava em São Francisco de Assis. Participar desse momento e ter esse contato direto foi muito emocionante\", pontuou.\nSobre o legado de Francisco, o missionário afirma que o papa plantou sementes importantes, principalmente em relação aos povos indígenas.\n\"Ele foi o primeiro papa a reconhecer os erros históricos da Igreja contra os povos indígenas e a pedir perdão pelos abusos cometidos contra os povos originários em nome da fé cristã. Trouxe os indígenas para o centro das discussões, reconheceu sua importância e ouviu suas vozes. Isso é histórico\".\nPor fim, Daniel espera que o sucessor do papa Francisco dê continuidade ao caminho iniciado por ele.\n“Espero que o próximo papa cuide da semente que Francisco plantou. Ele estava dando continuidade às reformas iniciadas no Concílio Vaticano II. Que esse caminho continue sendo trilhado\", concluiu. \nComo lembrança daquele encontro inesquecível, Daniel guarda até hoje uma moeda com o brasão do pontificado de Francisco, entregue pelo próprio papa a todos os participantes no último dia do Sínodo.\nDaniel Lima recebeu do papa Francisco uma moeda com o brasão do pontificado, símbolo do legado da Igreja na Amazônia.\nArquivo pessoal\nDaniel Lima com o papa Francisco durante o Sínodo da Amazônia, em 2019\nArquivo pessoal\nPapa Francisco pede respeito aos indígenas ao encerrar Sínodo da Amazônia",

Both leaders once again signalled a thaw in frosty ties, reaffirming their commitment to resolving the issue through dialogue.</p>\n<p>Later, talking to a private news channel in the evening, Rana Sanaullah said PM Shehbaz Sharif’s government believed in resolving all matters through mutual understanding, and that it was not possible for any province to be deprived of its rightful share.</p>\n<p>    <figure class=\"media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven\">\n        <div class=\"media__item  media__item--newskitlink  \">    </div>\n        \n    </figure></p>\n<p>“Under the [1991] Water Accord, no pr­o­v­ince’s water can be diverted to an­other, nor is it being done,” he said. “The distribution of water is an administrative and technical issue, and it will be resolved on administrative and technical grounds. Let me be very clear that no province will be deprived of its rights, provincial concerns will be addressed, and the process of consultation will be further expanded.”</p>\n<p>Although the Sindh government did not come up with an immediate reaction to the latest response from Islamabad, Infor­ma­tion Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon iss­ued a statement urging mainly nationalist parties — currently staging sit-ins acr­oss the province and blocking roads and highways in protest against the canal project — to ensure that their demonstrations do not cause inconvenience to the public.</p>\n<p>“The political parties have a constitutional right to peaceful protest on the issue of the canal,” the statement quoted Mr Memon as saying. “Demonstrations, rallies, processions — whatever form a party chooses to protest in — they should inform the government and hold their protests in open spaces or areas where the public does not face inconvenience. The protest and dissent are the essence of every democracy, but the protest should not cause trouble for the public.”</p>\n<p>However, the Sindh minister is scheduled to hold a press conference today, in which he is expected to address the canals issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Unabated criticism</strong></p>\n<p>Despite all the headway, unless the engagement between the two sides translates into a tangible outcome, the exchange of criticism from both ends is likely to continue unabated. It was Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari who first took a potshot at PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, criticising him for his “harsh” remarks.</p>\n<p>The minister said if Punjab did not purchase wheat under its policy, it didn’t leave the farmers helpless either. Punjab’s farmers will be given a Rs100 billion package, Rs5,000 per acre, and a Rs25 billion wheat programme. Punjab’s farmers have been given Kisan Cards, thousands of tractors, and super seeders.</p>\n<p>“It is unfortunate that no one has spoken about the condition of Sindh’s farmers. Neither was a wheat price fixed nor were Kisan Cards issued. In contrast, the Punjab government has taken multiple steps for the welfare of farmers.”</p>\n<p><strong>‘No compromise’</strong></p>\n<p>Hours later, senior PPP leader and Sindh minister Saeed Ghani strongly criticised the PML-N, accusing it of “deliberately attempting” to weaken his party over the controversial canal project. Speaking to the media in Karachi, Mr Ghani made it clear that the PPP would not compromise on the construction of new canals.</p>\n<p>    <figure class=\"media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven\">\n        <div class=\"media__item  media__item--newskitlink  \">    </div>\n        \n    </figure></p>\n<p>“It seems PML-N wants to harm the PPP. They must remove any notion from their minds that we will accept the canal projects through negotiations. We categorically reject them,” he said.</p>\n<p>According to Mr Ghani, President Asif Ali Zardari holds no executive power under the Constitution, and in Pakistan’s parliamentary system, such powers lie with the prime minister. However, even the PM does not have the authority to decide water distribution, he added.</p>\n<p>“President Zardari publicly opposed the canal projects in the joint session of parliament. Opposition parties are beating drums over something no one actually heard,” he said while responding to criticism about President Zardari’s alleged support for the project in a “closed-door meeting”.</p>\n<p><em>Zulqernain Tahir in Lahore also contributed to this report</em></p>\n<p><em>Published in Dawn, April 22nd, 2025</em></p>",

However, $1.2bn received a year back under the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) had also seen similar accounting treatment.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote-level-1\">\n<p>Expected inflow of $9bn from Saudi Arabia and China critical to meet external funding gap in FY25</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With three rollovers and fresh disbursements, the total external assistance in nine months amounted to $12.46bn. This included $3bn rollovers by Saudi Arabia, $2bn by UAE and $1bn by China. This does not include another $2bn China rolled over last month, making its total rollover to $3bn thus far. Pakistan has a total annual rollover portfolio of about $12.7bn in safe deposits and loans from these three countries, leaving the country’s net international reserves (NIR) at a deficit.</p>\n<p>The foreign economic assistance recorded by the EAD showed inflows fell by about 20.2pc to about $5.5bn in July-March, apparently because of delayed IMF bailout and subsequent $1bn disbursements. Last year, these inflows amounted to $7.9bn in these nine months, including IMF.</p>\n<p>In March this year, the EAD reported monthly inflows at $555 million, compared to $365m in February and $830m in January.</p>\n<p>The EAD said that out of $5.5b, about $3bn was received for budgetary support or programme loans and the remaining $2.4bn for project financing. During the same period last year, EAD secured about $2.2bn as project aid and $4.7bn as programme loans.</p>\n<p>Of the total, inflows from multilaterals stood at $2.83bn in 9MFY25 compared to $2.7bn last year, while bilateral disbursements stood at $358.5m against $870m last year.</p>\n<p>The EAD reported to have received about $504m in loans from foreign commercial lenders (UAE-based) in nine months of the current year, showing a minor recovery from commercial banks who had stayed away from financing Pakistan last year. It may be noted that the government has budgeted $3.8bn in financing from foreign commercial banks for the current year, showing a poor start, again due to the delayed IMF umbrella.</p>\n<p>The government has also targeted $1bn in international bonds for the current year. A projection for $9bn inflow from China and Saudi Arabia was targeted for FY25. These projections include a $5bn time deposit from Saudi Arabia and $4bn China’s SAFE deposit. These projections are critical for Pakistan to meet its external financing gap as part of the IMF programme.</p>\n<p>In addition, Pakistan also received $1.455bn from overseas Pakistanis through Naya Pakistan Certificates compared to $781m in the same period last year.</p>\n<p>The Asian Development Bank disbursed $1.189bn in 9MFY25 compared to $665m a year ago, and $979m was received from the World Bank.</p>\n<p><em>Published in Dawn, April 22nd, 2025</em></p>",

But later, his wife’s medical treatment was restored.</p>\n<p><strong>The hearing</strong></p>\n<p>During the hearing of the review application on Monday, a PAF official told the court that Saeed was detained under the Official Secrets Act.</p>\n<p>After a court-martial by a PAF tribunal, he was sentenced to 14 years’ imprisonment. The air chief has reduced the sentence by 10 years and Saeed was serving the remaining four-year term.</p>\n<p>The PAF official informed IHC that Saeed was detai­ned at an Officers’ Mess instead of a prison, where army officers serve their sentences after conviction as per law.</p>\n<p>The petitioner’s counsel, retired Col Inamur Rahim, arg­ued that Saeed was being kept in illegal custody by PAF. He said that as a constitutional court, the IHC was duty-bound to set aside the “unlawful confinement”.</p>\n<p>He pointed out that following the conviction, convicts were sent to jail to complete the sentence. However, the PAF kept Saeed in its own custody.</p>\n<p>Advocate Rahim said that Saeed was among the contenders for the post of air chief in 2021, but retired from service on March 18, 2021, after he was not promoted as air chief. The officer was taken into custody on January 1, 2024, the lawyer added.</p>\n<p>Being a civilian, he could not be tried by the PAF Tribunal, he argued, adding that despite his conviction, Saeed was not handed over to jail authorities.</p>\n<p>The PAF official informed the judge that the air chief had declared the Officer’s Mess as sub-jail. Therefore, Saeed was detained there in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p>Mr Rahim contested the assertion, saying such confinement was illegal.</p>\n<p>He also said that authorities did not share details of the court-martial proceedings, leaving the convict unable to file an appeal in court.</p>\n<p>The judge then directed PAF to share relevant details with the counsel and adjourned the hearing till April 29.</p>\n<p><em>Published in Dawn, April 22nd, 2025</em></p>",

Whoever comes in the caravan is fine, we will not force Maulana Sahib to support us,” he said during an appearance on <em>DawnNewsTV</em> on Monday.</p>\n<p>He said the Maulana had his own political party, and if he did not want to join hands with the PTI, then it was his decision to make.</p>\n<p>The PTI had earlier been quite confident that it would be able to win over the veteran politician from Dera Ismail Khan with help from their allies in the Tehreek Tahaffuz Aayen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) alliance.</p>\n<p>However, the recent brouhaha over whether the incarcerated PTI founder was willing to cut a deal with the establishment for his release seems to have driven a wedge between the two parties.</p>\n<p>Recently, PTI leader Azam Swati  — whose previous allegiances include the JUI-F  — <a href=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/1902573\">claimed</a> he had Imran Khan’s blessing to approach the establishment for talks. However, while this impression was refuted by other party leaders such as Salman Akram Raja and Omar Ayub, the JUI-F took exception and sought clarity from the PTI.</p>\n<p>    <figure class=\"media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven\">\n        <div class=\"media__item  media__item--newskitlink  \">    </div>\n        \n    </figure></p>\n<p>For his part, the Maulana’s recent remarks have indicated a cooling of tensions with PTI. During his press talk alongside the Jamaat-i-Islami chief in Mansoora on Monday, he expressed a willingness to “mend relations with the PTI to an extent where political dialogue is possible and national issues discussed”.</p>\n<p>The veteran politician said that while they also had political differences with the PPP and PML-N, this should not be construed as a personal enmity.</p>\n<p>“In the same spirit, we also want our relations with the PTI to be cordial enough to carry on political dialogue,” the Maulana said.</p>\n<p>But according to JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza, the party wants a definitive answer on whether the PTI seeks to launch an anti-government drive, or cosy up with the powers that be. In an earlier appearance on <em>DawnNewsTV</em>, Senator Murtaza had indicated that the JUI-F chief was ready to disengage with the PTI over this.</p>\n<p>“The JUI-F might not join the opposition alliance if the PTI has decided to engage with the establishment,” he had said.</p>\n<p>“If an alliance between the two parties is formed, then all decisions will need to be taken in light of party discipline,” Senator Murtaza claimed, adding that decisions would be taken through consensus in such a case.</p>\n<p>On Monday, Mr Ayub again denied the impression that his party was pursing the establishment, saying that no dialogue was taking place, nor were any attempts being made to initiate such talks.</p>\n<p>However, he maintained that all parties that were part of the TTAP alliance — led by PkMAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai — would be taken on board in case such a move was on the cards.</p>\n<p>Mr Ayub refused to answer when asked, point blank, whom these talks would be held with.</p>\n<p><em>Nadir Guramani in Islamabad and Ahmad Fraz Khan in Lahore contributed to this report</em></p>\n<p><em>Published in Dawn, April 22nd, 2025</em></p>",

Warner, the season’s biggest signing of the league, set the tone, as the southpaw battled seam and low bounce with deft drives and ramps, notably against Ali Raza (2-32), whom he plundered for three fours in the 14th over, including a ramp to fine leg and a slash past point.</p>\n<p>His fifty, reached with a slice to deep point off Arif Yaqoob (1-18), steadied Kings at 107-5 before Wood’s back-of-the-hand slower ball, however, clean-bowled Warner in the 17th over, sparking Zalmi’s wild celebrations as Kings needed 29 off 21. Abbas Afridi and Aamer Jamal fell quickly, leaving Khushdil to face the pressure at 133-8.</p>\n<p>In scintillating form this season, Khushdil rose to the occasion. Against Ali, he played cautiously, nurdling singles to keep the chase alive, but unleashed his power against Hussain Talat in the final over, as they required nine to win.</p>\n<p>A hammered four past backward point off a short, wide ball set the tone, and after a single, Hasan Ali’s (six not out off three) exquisite pull for another boundary sealed the win for Karachi, sparking delirium among the raucous crowd, whose energy outshone the leg’s earlier matches.</p>\n<p>Earlier, Tim Seifert fell on the very first ball to Wood, James Vince (11 off nine, two fours) nicked off, and Saad Baig was bowled by Ali. Mohammad Nabi (14 off 11, a four and a six) and Irfan Khan (10 off 16) kept Kings’ hopes alive but Arif’s spin and a run-out tightened the screws, making Khushdil’s composure pivotal.</p>\n<p>Earlier after being put into bat, Zalmi posted a fighting 147-8, setting the stage for a tense chase on a bowler-friendly pitch.</p>\n<p>The Zalmi innings, marked by disciplined bowling from Kings and flashes of resilience from Babar Azam and Alzarri Joseph, unfolded as a tale of survival and sporadic defiance.</p>\n<p>Kings unleashed their pace battery with Mir Hamza (1-14) setting the tone. His opening spell was a masterclass, exploiting early swing and seam to keep Zalmi openers, Babar and Saim Ayub, on a leash.</p>\n<p>Hamza’s probing lines accounted for Saim, who fell to a rash shot, caught by Vince at backward point. Babar, surviving an early lbw scare via review, battled through a testing powerplay, managing 19 off 25 by the sixth over, but the pitch’s behaviour stifled fluency.</p>\n<p>The middle overs saw Zalmi wrestle for momentum. Tom Kohler-Cadmore’s brief stay at the crease ended with a stunning catch by Irfan off Khushdil (3-20), whose crafty spin dismantled Zalmi’s core.</p>\n<p>Babar, anchoring the innings, found rhythm with elegant drives, amassing 46 off 41, including seven fours. Yet, his attempt to accelerate was thwarted by Khushdil’s quicker delivery, trapping him lbw in the 10th over — a crucial blow.</p>\n<p>Mohammad Haris (28 off 21) injected impetus with audacious strokeplay but Abbas’ (3-30) cunning slower ball sent him packing, caught by Warner.</p>\n<p>Kings’ bowlers maintained relentless pressure. Abbas excelled at the death, dismissing Hussain (18 off 16) and Wood, while Khushdil’s guile removed Mitchell Owen.</p>\n<p>With Zalmi reeling at 111-5 after 16 overs, Alzarri Joseph’s late flourish (24 not out off 13, two fours and a six) provided a lifeline. His muscular hits, alongside a few wayward deliveries from Hasan, pushed Zalmi close to 150 — a total that, given the pitch’s challenges, proved just short.</p>\n<p><strong>SCOREBOARD</strong></p>\n<p><strong>PESHAWAR ZALMI:</strong></p>\n<p>Babar Azam lbw b Khushdil\t46</p>\n<p>Saim Ayub c Vince b Hamza\t4</p>\n<p>Tom Kohler-Cadmore c Irfan b Khushdil\t7</p>\n<p>Mohammad Haris c Warner b Abbas\t28</p>\n<p>Hussain Talat c&amp;b Aamer\t18</p>\n<p>Mitchell Owen lbw b Khushdil\t5</p>\n<p>Abdul Samad c Hamza b Abbas\t2</p>\n<p>Alzarri Joseph not out\t24</p>\n<p>Luke Wood c Aamer b Abbas\t2</p>\n<p>Arif Yaqoob not out\t1</p>\n<p>EXTRAS (LB-1, NB-1, W-8)\t10</p>\n<p>TOTAL (for eight wickets, 20 overs)\t147</p>\n<p>DID NOT BAT: Ali Raza</p>\n<p>FALL OF WICKETS: 1-9 (Saim), 2-36 (Kohler-Cadmore), 3-67 (Babar), 4-104 (Hussain), 5-111 (Owen), 6-115 (Haris), 7-131 (Samad), 8-136 (Wood)</p>\n<p>BOWLING: Hamza 4-0-14-1 (1w), Hasan 4-0-33-0 (3w, 1nb), Abbas 4-0-30-3 (1w), Khushdil 3-0-20-3, Nabi 3-0-28-0 (1w), Aamer 2-0-21-1 (2w)</p>\n<p><strong>KARACHI KINGS:</strong></p>\n<p>Tim Seifert lbw b Wood\t0</p>\n<p>David Warner b Wood\t60</p>\n<p>James Vince c Haris b Wood\t11</p>\n<p>Saad Baig b Ali\t9</p>\n<p>Irfan Khan run out\t10</p>\n<p>Mohammad Nabi c Samad b Arif\t14</p>\n<p>Khushdil Shah not out\t23</p>\n<p>Abbas Afridi c Kohler-Cadmore b Joseph\t2</p>\n<p>Aamer Jamal lbw b Ali\t1</p>\n<p>Hasan Ali not out\t6</p>\n<p>EXTRAS (LB-5, NB-2, W-5)\t12</p>\n<p>TOTAL (for eight wickets, 19.3 overs)\t148</p>\n<p>DID NOT BAT: Mir Hamza</p>\n<p>FALL OF WICKETS: 1-0 (Seifert), 2-19 (Vince), 3-42 (Saad), 4-68 (Irfan), 5-89 (Nabi), 6-119 (Warner), 7-132 (Abbas), 8-133 (Aamer)</p>\n<p>BOWLING: Wood 4-0-28-3 (2w, 1nb), Joseph 4-0-36-1, Ali 4-0-32-2 (2w, 1nb), Saim 3-0-20-0, Arif 4-0-18-1 (1w), Hussain 0.3-0-9-0</p>\n<p>RESULT: Karachi Kings won by two wickets.</p>\n<p>PLAYER-OF-THE-MATCH: Khushdil Shah</p>\n<p><em>Published in Dawn, April 22nd, 2025</em></p>",

Police and other law enforcement personnel have been tasked to escort the teams and ensure their safety, especially in sensitive areas.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Islamabad administration asked community leaders and school officials to play their part in spreading awareness and encouraging participation. Authorities said that awareness efforts are key to countering misinformation and building trust in the vaccine.</p>\n<p>In the coming days, district officials will monitor the progress of the campaign through regular field visits. Mobile teams will also be deployed to cover remote and underserved areas. These teams will move from one locality to another to make sure every child is vaccinated, regardless of where they live.

A reporting and feedback system has been set up to track such cases and ensure they are not left behind.</p>\n<p><em>Published in Dawn, April 22nd, 2025</em></p>",

        "summary": "<p>At the crack of dawn, around 6am, Amina is already in line with two buckets. She’ll wait nearly an hour for water — if it comes. If not, she’ll walk 15 minutes to a neighbour who sells it by the jerrycan. She does this every day before making breakfast for her family.</p>\n<p>During the day, when her five-year-old needs to use the toilet, she’ll walk him to the end of the lane where a few families share a makeshift bathroom. It has no door, no water, and no drainage. In her neighbourhood, like many of Karachi’s informal settlements, clean water and safe sanitation access is a daily struggle.</p>\n<p>Amina’s story isn’t unique. It reflects the everyday reality of millions of people in Karachi’s <em>katchi abadis</em> (informal settlements) that house nearly half the city’s population. These communities are often lumped together, treated as a single, uniform category in policy discussions, as if every <em>katchi abadi</em> faces the same conditions and challenges. But in truth, they vary widely in how much access they have to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services.</p>\n<p>Our recent <a class=\"link--external\" href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4505/adb453\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> of five informal settlements across Karachi reveals just how stark these differences can be. If Karachi is serious about addressing its water and sanitation crisis, the solution does not lie in billion-rupee mega-projects. Real change must begin in the city’s most underserved communities, where even modest investments can dramatically improve daily life for millions.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/1883082\" /></p>\n<h2><a class=\"heading-permalink\" href=\"#a-tale-of-two-settlements\" id=\"a-tale-of-two-settlements\" title=\"Permalink\"></a>A tale of two settlements</h2>\n<p>Consider the contrast between Manzoor Colony and Ilyas Goth.</p>\n<p>Manzoor Colony, a settlement regularised in the early 1990s with <a class=\"link--external\" href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956247806069626\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">support from the Orangi Pilot Project</a>, has basic but functioning infrastructure. Nearly every household has piped water, flush toilets, and overhead storage tanks. As a result, residents report fewer waterborne illnesses compared to other settlements.</p>\n<p>Ilyas Goth, by contrast, is a small settlement located next to an open sewer. No household has piped water or a private toilet. Residents collect water from neighbours or a nearby <em>dhaba</em>, using only around 13 litres per person per day. This is not just below international benchmarks; it is lower than usage in other water-scarce areas of Karachi and falls beneath the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) <a class=\"link--external\" href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/water-sanitation-and-health/environmental-health-in-emergencies/humanitarian-emergencies\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">emergency minimum of 15 litres per person per day</a> used in disaster zones. Sanitation access is equally dire. Only one public toilet exists in the entire community, reserved for women and costing Rs20 per use. Unsurprisingly, three out of four households in Ilyas Goth reported a waterborne illness in the past two months.</p>\n<h2><a class=\"heading-permalink\" href=\"#does-legal-recognition-help-it-depends\" id=\"does-legal-recognition-help-it-depends\" title=\"Permalink\"></a>Does legal recognition help? It depends</h2>\n<p>A key difference between these two settlements is their status in the eyes of the state. Manzoor Colony is regularised, whereas Ilyas Goth is not. But our <a class=\"link--external\" href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4505/adb453\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> suggests that legal recognition, also known as regularisation, is neither a pre-requisite nor a guarantee of better WASH outcomes.</p>\n<p>Take Sherpao Basti, for example. Though unregularised, this settlement is located near the affluent KDA Scheme 1 and fares better than many regularised neighbourhoods. Two-thirds of households have piped water, and nearly all have on-premises flush toilets. In fact, water availability is high enough that residents from neighbouring settlements often come here to collect water.</p>\n<p>Compare that with Quaid-i-Azam Colony, a recently regularised settlement that still struggles. Only one-third of households have piped water, and the rest rely on costly private borewells. Despite its legal status, this community has yet to see the benefits that regularisation is assumed to bring.</p>\n<p>    <figure class=\"media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven\">\n        <div class=\"media__item  media__item--newskitlink  \">    </div>\n        \n    </figure></p>\n<h2><a class=\"heading-permalink\" href=\"#the-missing-link--institutional-fragmentation\" id=\"the-missing-link--institutional-fragmentation\" title=\"Permalink\"></a>The missing link — institutional fragmentation</h2>\n<p>Why does regularisation not always improve service access? The answer lies in how Karachi’s institutions have evolved.</p>\n<p>As one Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) official explained: “Before 1996, water and sewage services in Karachi were managed as part of the KMC. Since KMC was often involved in the land acquisition process for regularisation, this allowed water and sanitation to be considered within that process. But in 1996, KWSC [Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation] became a separate utility, and it’s no longer involved in regularisation.”</p>\n<p>In earlier decades, even though the Sindh Katchi Abadis Act did not formally require the water utility to provide services during regularisation, the city government’s integrated structure meant that WASH needs were still addressed. But today, with KWSC operating separately, that connection has broken down. Newly regularised settlements are left in a limbo, recognised by the land department but ignored by the service provider.</p>\n<p>These institutional shifts make it clear that regularisation, without clear mandates for service provision, is not enough. Karachi needs to amend its processes to ensure that the utility and relevant government bodies are jointly responsible for delivering basic services to regularised settlements.</p>\n<h2><a class=\"heading-permalink\" href=\"#more-than-pipes-and-toilets\" id=\"more-than-pipes-and-toilets\" title=\"Permalink\"></a>More than pipes and toilets</h2>\n<p>While regularisation and basic infrastructure are often seen as milestones of progress, even in settlements where these boxes are checked, residents continue to face unsafe conditions. Having taps and toilets does not always mean people have safe water or hygienic sanitation. In four of the five settlements we studied, most households technically used improved water sources and sanitation facilities. The infrastructure was there: piped connections, on-premises toilets, and in some cases, water storage systems.</p>\n<p>But dig a little deeper, and a different story emerges. Intermittent water supply and poor-quality internal plumbing often result in cross-contamination between sewage and drinking water lines. Household-level water treatment is rare. Combined, this means that even with infrastructure in place, the water reaching people’s homes may be unsafe to drink. The result is a continued burden of disease, especially among children and the elderly, and rising health expenditures that low-income households can ill afford.</p>\n<p>    <figure class=\"media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven\">\n        <div class=\"media__item  media__item--newskitlink  \">    </div>\n        \n    </figure></p>\n<h2><a class=\"heading-permalink\" href=\"#targeted-interventions-not-mega-projects\" id=\"targeted-interventions-not-mega-projects\" title=\"Permalink\"></a>Targeted interventions, not mega projects</h2>\n<p>Understanding why some settlements fare better than others is key to designing smarter, more equitable policies. Yet the default policy response remains the same. Policymakers continue to favour large-scale infrastructure projects, such as new pipelines and desalination plants.</p>\n<p>Our findings suggests a better path forward. Improved governance, targeted investments, and community-centred solutions can yield far more sustainable outcomes. For instance, building gender-inclusive, community-managed sanitation facilities could improve both public health and dignity. Promoting low-cost household water treatment, through filters or chlorination, can significantly reduce disease burden. Supporting modest upgrades to internal plumbing networks can eliminate sources of contamination. These are not massive interventions, but they address the root causes of inequality more effectively than projects that bypass the city’s most vulnerable residents.</p>\n<p>To achieve lasting change, Karachi must adopt a more comprehensive approach to regularisation. Legal recognition must go hand in hand with actual service delivery. This means mandating that public utilities provide WASH services after a settlement is regularised. It also requires dedicated funding for improving internal infrastructure and support for civil society organisations that bridge the gap between residents and the state.</p>\n<p>Not all of Karachi’s informal settlements are the same. Some are holding on. Others are struggling to survive. But all are asking for more than just a dot on the map or a connection to the main line. They need services that are safe, reliable, and affordable. If Karachi is to become a more equitable and resilient city, policymakers must move beyond infrastructure and performative legislation, and commit to meaningful, people-centred reform.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Header Image:</strong> The image is generated via generative AI</em></p>\n<p><em>This article is the first of a four-part series on Karachi’s water issues.</em></p>",

During a meeting Hegseth had with his British counterpart at the Pentagon in March, his wife could be seen sitting behind him.</p>\n<p>Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell, without evidence, said that the media was “enthusiastically taking the grievances of disgruntled former employees as the sole sources for their article.” “The Trump-hating media continues to be obsessed with destroying anyone committed to President Trump’s agenda. We’ve already achieved so much for the American warfighter, and will never back down,” Parnell said in a statement on X.</p>\n<p>The latest revelation comes days after Dan Caldwell, one of Hegseth’s leading advisers, was escorted from the Pentagon after being identified during an investigation into leaks at the Department of Defence.</p>\n<p>Following Caldwell’s departure, less-senior officials Darin Selnick, who recently became Hegseth’s deputy chief of staff, and Colin Carroll, who was chief of staff to Deputy Defence Secretary Steve Feinberg, were put on administrative leave and fired on Friday.</p>\n<p>White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said that “recently fired leakers are continuing to misrepresent the truth to soothe their shattered egos and undermine the President’s agenda.</p>\n<p><strong>Tumultuous moment for Hegseth</strong></p>\n<p>Democratic lawmakers said Hegseth could no longer stay in his job. “We keep learning how Pete Hegseth put lives at risk,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a <a class=\"link--external\" href=\"https://x.com/SenSchumer/status/1914084912010870816\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> to X. “But Trump is still too weak to fire him.

He reiterated JI’s long-standing demand for a probe into electoral rigging and asserted that instead of holding new elections, the country needed a thorough investigation into the last polls for electoral transparency.</p>\n<p>Naeemur Rehman noted that this was his first meeting with Maulana Fazlur Rehman since becoming party chief and that further engagement would continue in future. Both sides agreed on the importance of upholding constitutional supremacy and stressed that all institutions must operate within their constitutional boundaries.</p>\n<p><em>Published in Dawn, April 22nd, 2025</em></p>",
