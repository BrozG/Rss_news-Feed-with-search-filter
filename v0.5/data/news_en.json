Both leaders once again signalled a thaw in frosty ties, reaffirming their commitment to resolving the issue through dialogue.</p>\n<p>Later, talking to a private news channel in the evening, Rana Sanaullah said PM Shehbaz Sharifâs government believed in resolving all matters through mutual understanding, and that it was not possible for any province to be deprived of its rightful share.</p>\n<p>    <figure class=\"media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven\">\n        <div class=\"media__item  media__item--newskitlink  \">    </div>\n        \n    </figure></p>\n<p>âUnder the [1991] Water Accord, no prÂ­oÂ­vÂ­inceâs water can be diverted to anÂ­other, nor is it being done,â he said. âThe distribution of water is an administrative and technical issue, and it will be resolved on administrative and technical grounds. Let me be very clear that no province will be deprived of its rights, provincial concerns will be addressed, and the process of consultation will be further expanded.â</p>\n<p>Although the Sindh government did not come up with an immediate reaction to the latest response from Islamabad, InforÂ­maÂ­tion Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon issÂ­ued a statement urging mainly nationalist parties â currently staging sit-ins acrÂ­oss the province and blocking roads and highways in protest against the canal project â to ensure that their demonstrations do not cause inconvenience to the public.</p>\n<p>âThe political parties have a constitutional right to peaceful protest on the issue of the canal,â the statement quoted Mr Memon as saying. âDemonstrations, rallies, processions â whatever form a party chooses to protest in â they should inform the government and hold their protests in open spaces or areas where the public does not face inconvenience. The protest and dissent are the essence of every democracy, but the protest should not cause trouble for the public.â</p>\n<p>However, the Sindh minister is scheduled to hold a press conference today, in which he is expected to address the canals issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Unabated criticism</strong></p>\n<p>Despite all the headway, unless the engagement between the two sides translates into a tangible outcome, the exchange of criticism from both ends is likely to continue unabated. It was Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari who first took a potshot at PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, criticising him for his âharshâ remarks.</p>\n<p>The minister said if Punjab did not purchase wheat under its policy, it didnât leave the farmers helpless either. Punjabâs farmers will be given a Rs100 billion package, Rs5,000 per acre, and a Rs25 billion wheat programme. Punjabâs farmers have been given Kisan Cards, thousands of tractors, and super seeders.</p>\n<p>âIt is unfortunate that no one has spoken about the condition of Sindhâs farmers. Neither was a wheat price fixed nor were Kisan Cards issued. In contrast, the Punjab government has taken multiple steps for the welfare of farmers.â</p>\n<p><strong>âNo compromiseâ</strong></p>\n<p>Hours later, senior PPP leader and Sindh minister Saeed Ghani strongly criticised the PML-N, accusing it of âdeliberately attemptingâ to weaken his party over the controversial canal project. Speaking to the media in Karachi, Mr Ghani made it clear that the PPP would not compromise on the construction of new canals.</p>\n<p>    <figure class=\"media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven\">\n        <div class=\"media__item  media__item--newskitlink  \">    </div>\n        \n    </figure></p>\n<p>âIt seems PML-N wants to harm the PPP. They must remove any notion from their minds that we will accept the canal projects through negotiations. We categorically reject them,â he said.</p>\n<p>According to Mr Ghani, President Asif Ali Zardari holds no executive power under the Constitution, and in Pakistanâs parliamentary system, such powers lie with the prime minister. However, even the PM does not have the authority to decide water distribution, he added.</p>\n<p>âPresident Zardari publicly opposed the canal projects in the joint session of parliament. Opposition parties are beating drums over something no one actually heard,â he said while responding to criticism about President Zardariâs alleged support for the project in a âclosed-door meetingâ.</p>\n<p><em>Zulqernain Tahir in Lahore also contributed to this report</em></p>\n<p><em>Published in Dawn, April 22nd, 2025</em></p>",

However, $1.2bn received a year back under the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) had also seen similar accounting treatment.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote-level-1\">\n<p>Expected inflow of $9bn from Saudi Arabia and China critical to meet external funding gap in FY25</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With three rollovers and fresh disbursements, the total external assistance in nine months amounted to $12.46bn. This included $3bn rollovers by Saudi Arabia, $2bn by UAE and $1bn by China. This does not include another $2bn China rolled over last month, making its total rollover to $3bn thus far. Pakistan has a total annual rollover portfolio of about $12.7bn in safe deposits and loans from these three countries, leaving the countryâs net international reserves (NIR) at a deficit.</p>\n<p>The foreign economic assistance recorded by the EAD showed inflows fell by about 20.2pc to about $5.5bn in July-March, apparently because of delayed IMF bailout and subsequent $1bn disbursements. Last year, these inflows amounted to $7.9bn in these nine months, including IMF.</p>\n<p>In March this year, the EAD reported monthly inflows at $555 million, compared to $365m in February and $830m in January.</p>\n<p>The EAD said that out of $5.5b, about $3bn was received for budgetary support or programme loans and the remaining $2.4bn for project financing. During the same period last year, EAD secured about $2.2bn as project aid and $4.7bn as programme loans.</p>\n<p>Of the total, inflows from multilaterals stood at $2.83bn in 9MFY25 compared to $2.7bn last year, while bilateral disbursements stood at $358.5m against $870m last year.</p>\n<p>The EAD reported to have received about $504m in loans from foreign commercial lenders (UAE-based) in nine months of the current year, showing a minor recovery from commercial banks who had stayed away from financing Pakistan last year. It may be noted that the government has budgeted $3.8bn in financing from foreign commercial banks for the current year, showing a poor start, again due to the delayed IMF umbrella.</p>\n<p>The government has also targeted $1bn in international bonds for the current year. A projection for $9bn inflow from China and Saudi Arabia was targeted for FY25. These projections include a $5bn time deposit from Saudi Arabia and $4bn Chinaâs SAFE deposit. These projections are critical for Pakistan to meet its external financing gap as part of the IMF programme.</p>\n<p>In addition, Pakistan also received $1.455bn from overseas Pakistanis through Naya Pakistan Certificates compared to $781m in the same period last year.</p>\n<p>The Asian Development Bank disbursed $1.189bn in 9MFY25 compared to $665m a year ago, and $979m was received from the World Bank.</p>\n<p><em>Published in Dawn, April 22nd, 2025</em></p>",

He said that as a constitutional court, the IHC was duty-bound to set aside the âunlawful confinementâ.</p>\n<p>He pointed out that following the conviction, convicts were sent to jail to complete the sentence. However, the PAF kept Saeed in its own custody.</p>\n<p>Advocate Rahim said that Saeed was among the contenders for the post of air chief in 2021, but retired from service on March 18, 2021, after he was not promoted as air chief. The officer was taken into custody on January 1, 2024, the lawyer added.</p>\n<p>Being a civilian, he could not be tried by the PAF Tribunal, he argued, adding that despite his conviction, Saeed was not handed over to jail authorities.</p>\n<p>The PAF official informed the judge that the air chief had declared the Officerâs Mess as sub-jail. Therefore, Saeed was detained there in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p>Mr Rahim contested the assertion, saying such confinement was illegal.</p>\n<p>He also said that authorities did not share details of the court-martial proceedings, leaving the convict unable to file an appeal in court.</p>\n<p>The judge then directed PAF to share relevant details with the counsel and adjourned the hearing till April 29.</p>\n<p><em>Published in Dawn, April 22nd, 2025</em></p>",

Whoever comes in the caravan is fine, we will not force Maulana Sahib to support us,â he said during an appearance on <em>DawnNewsTV</em> on Monday.</p>\n<p>He said the Maulana had his own political party, and if he did not want to join hands with the PTI, then it was his decision to make.</p>\n<p>The PTI had earlier been quite confident that it would be able to win over the veteran politician from Dera Ismail Khan with help from their allies in the Tehreek Tahaffuz Aayen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) alliance.</p>\n<p>However, the recent brouhaha over whether the incarcerated PTI founder was willing to cut a deal with the establishment for his release seems to have driven a wedge between the two parties.</p>\n<p>Recently, PTI leader Azam Swati  â whose previous allegiances include the JUI-F  â <a href=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/1902573\">claimed</a> he had Imran Khanâs blessing to approach the establishment for talks. However, while this impression was refuted by other party leaders such as Salman Akram Raja and Omar Ayub, the JUI-F took exception and sought clarity from the PTI.</p>\n<p>    <figure class=\"media  sm:w-1/2  w-full  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven\">\n        <div class=\"media__item  media__item--newskitlink  \">    </div>\n        \n    </figure></p>\n<p>For his part, the Maulanaâs recent remarks have indicated a cooling of tensions with PTI. During his press talk alongside the Jamaat-i-Islami chief in Mansoora on Monday, he expressed a willingness to âmend relations with the PTI to an extent where political dialogue is possible and national issues discussedâ.</p>\n<p>The veteran politician said that while they also had political differences with the PPP and PML-N, this should not be construed as a personal enmity.</p>\n<p>âIn the same spirit, we also want our relations with the PTI to be cordial enough to carry on political dialogue,â the Maulana said.</p>\n<p>But according to JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza, the party wants a definitive answer on whether the PTI seeks to launch an anti-government drive, or cosy up with the powers that be. In an earlier appearance on <em>DawnNewsTV</em>, Senator Murtaza had indicated that the JUI-F chief was ready to disengage with the PTI over this.</p>\n<p>âThe JUI-F might not join the opposition alliance if the PTI has decided to engage with the establishment,â he had said.</p>\n<p>âIf an alliance between the two parties is formed, then all decisions will need to be taken in light of party discipline,â Senator Murtaza claimed, adding that decisions would be taken through consensus in such a case.</p>\n<p>On Monday, Mr Ayub again denied the impression that his party was pursing the establishment, saying that no dialogue was taking place, nor were any attempts being made to initiate such talks.</p>\n<p>However, he maintained that all parties that were part of the TTAP alliance â led by PkMAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai â would be taken on board in case such a move was on the cards.</p>\n<p>Mr Ayub refused to answer when asked, point blank, whom these talks would be held with.</p>\n<p><em>Nadir Guramani in Islamabad and Ahmad Fraz Khan in Lahore contributed to this report</em></p>\n<p><em>Published in Dawn, April 22nd, 2025</em></p>",

Warner, the seasonâs biggest signing of the league, set the tone, as the southpaw battled seam and low bounce with deft drives and ramps, notably against Ali Raza (2-32), whom he plundered for three fours in the 14th over, including a ramp to fine leg and a slash past point.</p>\n<p>His fifty, reached with a slice to deep point off Arif Yaqoob (1-18), steadied Kings at 107-5 before Woodâs back-of-the-hand slower ball, however, clean-bowled Warner in the 17th over, sparking Zalmiâs wild celebrations as Kings needed 29 off 21. Abbas Afridi and Aamer Jamal fell quickly, leaving Khushdil to face the pressure at 133-8.</p>\n<p>In scintillating form this season, Khushdil rose to the occasion. Against Ali, he played cautiously, nurdling singles to keep the chase alive, but unleashed his power against Hussain Talat in the final over, as they required nine to win.</p>\n<p>A hammered four past backward point off a short, wide ball set the tone, and after a single, Hasan Aliâs (six not out off three) exquisite pull for another boundary sealed the win for Karachi, sparking delirium among the raucous crowd, whose energy outshone the legâs earlier matches.</p>\n<p>Earlier, Tim Seifert fell on the very first ball to Wood, James Vince (11 off nine, two fours) nicked off, and Saad Baig was bowled by Ali. Mohammad Nabi (14 off 11, a four and a six) and Irfan Khan (10 off 16) kept Kingsâ hopes alive but Arifâs spin and a run-out tightened the screws, making Khushdilâs composure pivotal.</p>\n<p>Earlier after being put into bat, Zalmi posted a fighting 147-8, setting the stage for a tense chase on a bowler-friendly pitch.</p>\n<p>The Zalmi innings, marked by disciplined bowling from Kings and flashes of resilience from Babar Azam and Alzarri Joseph, unfolded as a tale of survival and sporadic defiance.</p>\n<p>Kings unleashed their pace battery with Mir Hamza (1-14) setting the tone. His opening spell was a masterclass, exploiting early swing and seam to keep Zalmi openers, Babar and Saim Ayub, on a leash.</p>\n<p>Hamzaâs probing lines accounted for Saim, who fell to a rash shot, caught by Vince at backward point. Babar, surviving an early lbw scare via review, battled through a testing powerplay, managing 19 off 25 by the sixth over, but the pitchâs behaviour stifled fluency.</p>\n<p>The middle overs saw Zalmi wrestle for momentum. Tom Kohler-Cadmoreâs brief stay at the crease ended with a stunning catch by Irfan off Khushdil (3-20), whose crafty spin dismantled Zalmiâs core.</p>\n<p>Babar, anchoring the innings, found rhythm with elegant drives, amassing 46 off 41, including seven fours. Yet, his attempt to accelerate was thwarted by Khushdilâs quicker delivery, trapping him lbw in the 10th over â a crucial blow.</p>\n<p>Mohammad Haris (28 off 21) injected impetus with audacious strokeplay but Abbasâ (3-30) cunning slower ball sent him packing, caught by Warner.</p>\n<p>Kingsâ bowlers maintained relentless pressure. Abbas excelled at the death, dismissing Hussain (18 off 16) and Wood, while Khushdilâs guile removed Mitchell Owen.</p>\n<p>With Zalmi reeling at 111-5 after 16 overs, Alzarri Josephâs late flourish (24 not out off 13, two fours and a six) provided a lifeline. His muscular hits, alongside a few wayward deliveries from Hasan, pushed Zalmi close to 150 â a total that, given the pitchâs challenges, proved just short.</p>\n<p><strong>SCOREBOARD</strong></p>\n<p><strong>PESHAWAR ZALMI:</strong></p>\n<p>Babar Azam lbw b Khushdil\t46</p>\n<p>Saim Ayub c Vince b Hamza\t4</p>\n<p>Tom Kohler-Cadmore c Irfan b Khushdil\t7</p>\n<p>Mohammad Haris c Warner b Abbas\t28</p>\n<p>Hussain Talat c&amp;b Aamer\t18</p>\n<p>Mitchell Owen lbw b Khushdil\t5</p>\n<p>Abdul Samad c Hamza b Abbas\t2</p>\n<p>Alzarri Joseph not out\t24</p>\n<p>Luke Wood c Aamer b Abbas\t2</p>\n<p>Arif Yaqoob not out\t1</p>\n<p>EXTRAS (LB-1, NB-1, W-8)\t10</p>\n<p>TOTAL (for eight wickets, 20 overs)\t147</p>\n<p>DID NOT BAT: Ali Raza</p>\n<p>FALL OF WICKETS: 1-9 (Saim), 2-36 (Kohler-Cadmore), 3-67 (Babar), 4-104 (Hussain), 5-111 (Owen), 6-115 (Haris), 7-131 (Samad), 8-136 (Wood)</p>\n<p>BOWLING: Hamza 4-0-14-1 (1w), Hasan 4-0-33-0 (3w, 1nb), Abbas 4-0-30-3 (1w), Khushdil 3-0-20-3, Nabi 3-0-28-0 (1w), Aamer 2-0-21-1 (2w)</p>\n<p><strong>KARACHI KINGS:</strong></p>\n<p>Tim Seifert lbw b Wood\t0</p>\n<p>David Warner b Wood\t60</p>\n<p>James Vince c Haris b Wood\t11</p>\n<p>Saad Baig b Ali\t9</p>\n<p>Irfan Khan run out\t10</p>\n<p>Mohammad Nabi c Samad b Arif\t14</p>\n<p>Khushdil Shah not out\t23</p>\n<p>Abbas Afridi c Kohler-Cadmore b Joseph\t2</p>\n<p>Aamer Jamal lbw b Ali\t1</p>\n<p>Hasan Ali not out\t6</p>\n<p>EXTRAS (LB-5, NB-2, W-5)\t12</p>\n<p>TOTAL (for eight wickets, 19.3 overs)\t148</p>\n<p>DID NOT BAT: Mir Hamza</p>\n<p>FALL OF WICKETS: 1-0 (Seifert), 2-19 (Vince), 3-42 (Saad), 4-68 (Irfan), 5-89 (Nabi), 6-119 (Warner), 7-132 (Abbas), 8-133 (Aamer)</p>\n<p>BOWLING: Wood 4-0-28-3 (2w, 1nb), Joseph 4-0-36-1, Ali 4-0-32-2 (2w, 1nb), Saim 3-0-20-0, Arif 4-0-18-1 (1w), Hussain 0.3-0-9-0</p>\n<p>RESULT: Karachi Kings won by two wickets.</p>\n<p>PLAYER-OF-THE-MATCH: Khushdil Shah</p>\n<p><em>Published in Dawn, April 22nd, 2025</em></p>",

Police and other law enforcement personnel have been tasked to escort the teams and ensure their safety, especially in sensitive areas.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Islamabad administration asked community leaders and school officials to play their part in spreading awareness and encouraging participation. Authorities said that awareness efforts are key to countering misinformation and building trust in the vaccine.</p>\n<p>In the coming days, district officials will monitor the progress of the campaign through regular field visits. Mobile teams will also be deployed to cover remote and underserved areas. These teams will move from one locality to another to make sure every child is vaccinated, regardless of where they live. According to health officials, the children who miss the vaccine this week will be identified and followed up on in the next round. A reporting and feedback system has been set up to track such cases and ensure they are not left behind.</p>\n<p><em>Published in Dawn, April 22nd, 2025</em></p>",

If not, sheâll walk 15 minutes to a neighbour who sells it by the jerrycan. She does this every day before making breakfast for her family.</p>\n<p>During the day, when her five-year-old needs to use the toilet, sheâll walk him to the end of the lane where a few families share a makeshift bathroom. It has no door, no water, and no drainage. In her neighbourhood, like many of Karachiâs informal settlements, clean water and safe sanitation access is a daily struggle.</p>\n<p>Aminaâs story isnât unique. It reflects the everyday reality of millions of people in Karachiâs <em>katchi abadis</em> (informal settlements) that house nearly half the cityâs population. These communities are often lumped together, treated as a single, uniform category in policy discussions, as if every <em>katchi abadi</em> faces the same conditions and challenges. But in truth, they vary widely in how much access they have to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services.</p>\n<p>Our recent <a class=\"link--external\" href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4505/adb453\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> of five informal settlements across Karachi reveals just how stark these differences can be. If Karachi is serious about addressing its water and sanitation crisis, the solution does not lie in billion-rupee mega-projects. Real change must begin in the cityâs most underserved communities, where even modest investments can dramatically improve daily life for millions.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/1883082\" /></p>\n<h2><a class=\"heading-permalink\" href=\"#a-tale-of-two-settlements\" id=\"a-tale-of-two-settlements\" title=\"Permalink\"></a>A tale of two settlements</h2>\n<p>Consider the contrast between Manzoor Colony and Ilyas Goth.</p>\n<p>Manzoor Colony, a settlement regularised in the early 1990s with <a class=\"link--external\" href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956247806069626\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">support from the Orangi Pilot Project</a>, has basic but functioning infrastructure. Nearly every household has piped water, flush toilets, and overhead storage tanks. As a result, residents report fewer waterborne illnesses compared to other settlements.</p>\n<p>Ilyas Goth, by contrast, is a small settlement located next to an open sewer. No household has piped water or a private toilet. Residents collect water from neighbours or a nearby <em>dhaba</em>, using only around 13 litres per person per day. This is not just below international benchmarks; it is lower than usage in other water-scarce areas of Karachi and falls beneath the World Health Organisationâs (WHO) <a class=\"link--external\" href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/water-sanitation-and-health/environmental-health-in-emergencies/humanitarian-emergencies\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">emergency minimum of 15 litres per person per day</a> used in disaster zones. Sanitation access is equally dire. Only one public toilet exists in the entire community, reserved for women and costing Rs20 per use. Unsurprisingly, three out of four households in Ilyas Goth reported a waterborne illness in the past two months.</p>\n<h2><a class=\"heading-permalink\" href=\"#does-legal-recognition-help-it-depends\" id=\"does-legal-recognition-help-it-depends\" title=\"Permalink\"></a>Does legal recognition help? It depends</h2>\n<p>A key difference between these two settlements is their status in the eyes of the state. Manzoor Colony is regularised, whereas Ilyas Goth is not. But our <a class=\"link--external\" href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4505/adb453\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> suggests that legal recognition, also known as regularisation, is neither a pre-requisite nor a guarantee of better WASH outcomes.</p>\n<p>Take Sherpao Basti, for example. Though unregularised, this settlement is located near the affluent KDA Scheme 1 and fares better than many regularised neighbourhoods. Two-thirds of households have piped water, and nearly all have on-premises flush toilets. In fact, water availability is high enough that residents from neighbouring settlements often come here to collect water.</p>\n<p>Compare that with Quaid-i-Azam Colony, a recently regularised settlement that still struggles. Only one-third of households have piped water, and the rest rely on costly private borewells. Despite its legal status, this community has yet to see the benefits that regularisation is assumed to bring.</p>\n<p>    <figure class=\"media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven\">\n        <div class=\"media__item  media__item--newskitlink  \">    </div>\n        \n    </figure></p>\n<h2><a class=\"heading-permalink\" href=\"#the-missing-link--institutional-fragmentation\" id=\"the-missing-link--institutional-fragmentation\" title=\"Permalink\"></a>The missing link â institutional fragmentation</h2>\n<p>Why does regularisation not always improve service access? The answer lies in how Karachiâs institutions have evolved.</p>\n<p>As one Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) official explained: âBefore 1996, water and sewage services in Karachi were managed as part of the KMC. Since KMC was often involved in the land acquisition process for regularisation, this allowed water and sanitation to be considered within that process. But in 1996, KWSC [Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation] became a separate utility, and itâs no longer involved in regularisation.â</p>\n<p>In earlier decades, even though the Sindh Katchi Abadis Act did not formally require the water utility to provide services during regularisation, the city governmentâs integrated structure meant that WASH needs were still addressed. But today, with KWSC operating separately, that connection has broken down. Newly regularised settlements are left in a limbo, recognised by the land department but ignored by the service provider.</p>\n<p>These institutional shifts make it clear that regularisation, without clear mandates for service provision, is not enough. Karachi needs to amend its processes to ensure that the utility and relevant government bodies are jointly responsible for delivering basic services to regularised settlements.</p>\n<h2><a class=\"heading-permalink\" href=\"#more-than-pipes-and-toilets\" id=\"more-than-pipes-and-toilets\" title=\"Permalink\"></a>More than pipes and toilets</h2>\n<p>While regularisation and basic infrastructure are often seen as milestones of progress, even in settlements where these boxes are checked, residents continue to face unsafe conditions. Having taps and toilets does not always mean people have safe water or hygienic sanitation. In four of the five settlements we studied, most households technically used improved water sources and sanitation facilities. The infrastructure was there: piped connections, on-premises toilets, and in some cases, water storage systems.</p>\n<p>But dig a little deeper, and a different story emerges. Intermittent water supply and poor-quality internal plumbing often result in cross-contamination between sewage and drinking water lines. Household-level water treatment is rare. Combined, this means that even with infrastructure in place, the water reaching peopleâs homes may be unsafe to drink. The result is a continued burden of disease, especially among children and the elderly, and rising health expenditures that low-income households can ill afford.</p>\n<p>    <figure class=\"media  w-full  w-full  media--stretch  media--embed  media--uneven\">\n        <div class=\"media__item  media__item--newskitlink  \">    </div>\n        \n    </figure></p>\n<h2><a class=\"heading-permalink\" href=\"#targeted-interventions-not-mega-projects\" id=\"targeted-interventions-not-mega-projects\" title=\"Permalink\"></a>Targeted interventions, not mega projects</h2>\n<p>Understanding why some settlements fare better than others is key to designing smarter, more equitable policies. Yet the default policy response remains the same. Policymakers continue to favour large-scale infrastructure projects, such as new pipelines and desalination plants.</p>\n<p>Our findings suggests a better path forward. Improved governance, targeted investments, and community-centred solutions can yield far more sustainable outcomes. For instance, building gender-inclusive, community-managed sanitation facilities could improve both public health and dignity. Promoting low-cost household water treatment, through filters or chlorination, can significantly reduce disease burden. Supporting modest upgrades to internal plumbing networks can eliminate sources of contamination. These are not massive interventions, but they address the root causes of inequality more effectively than projects that bypass the cityâs most vulnerable residents.</p>\n<p>To achieve lasting change, Karachi must adopt a more comprehensive approach to regularisation. Legal recognition must go hand in hand with actual service delivery. This means mandating that public utilities provide WASH services after a settlement is regularised. It also requires dedicated funding for improving internal infrastructure and support for civil society organisations that bridge the gap between residents and the state.</p>\n<p>Not all of Karachiâs informal settlements are the same. Some are holding on. Others are struggling to survive. But all are asking for more than just a dot on the map or a connection to the main line. They need services that are safe, reliable, and affordable. If Karachi is to become a more equitable and resilient city, policymakers must move beyond infrastructure and performative legislation, and commit to meaningful, people-centred reform.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Header Image:</strong> The image is generated via generative AI</em></p>\n<p><em>This article is the first of a four-part series on Karachiâs water issues.</em></p>",

Ukraine, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States â we are ready to move forward as constructively as possible,â Zelensky said on X on Monday.</p>\n<p>âAn unconditional ceasefire must be the first step toward peace,â he added.
